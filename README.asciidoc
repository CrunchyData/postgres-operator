= PostgreSQL Operator

v3.0, {docdate}

The *postgres-operator* is a controller that runs within a Kubernetes cluster that provides a means to deploy and manage PostgreSQL clusters.

Use the *postgres-operator* to:

 * deploy PostgreSQL containers including streaming replication clusters
 * scale up PostgreSQL clusters with extra replicas
 * add pgpool and metrics sidecars to PostgreSQL clusters
 * apply SQL policies to PostgreSQL clusters
 * assign metadata tags to PostgreSQL clusters
 * maintain PostgreSQL users and passwords
 * perform minor and major upgrades to PostgreSQL clusters
 * load simple CSV and JSON files into PostgreSQL clusters
 * perform database backups

== Design

The *postgres-operator* design incorporates the following concepts:

 * adds Custom Resource Definitions for PostgreSQL to Kubernetes
 * adds controller logic that watches events on PostgreSQL resources
 * provides a command line client (*pgo*) and REST API for interfacing with the postgres-operator
 * provides for very customized deployments including container resources, storage configurations, and PostgreSQL custom configurations

More design information is found on the link:docs/design.asciidoc[Design] page.

== Requirements

The *postgres-operator* runs on Kubernetes and Openshift platforms that support 
CRD (custom resource definitions).

== Quickstart 

Quickstart scripts are provided for GKE and Openshift currently.  More information is found on the link:docs/quickstarts.asciidoc[Quickstarts] page.

== Installation

To build and deploy the Operator on your Kubernetes system, follow the instructions documented on the link:docs/install.asciidoc[Installation] page.

== Configuration

The operator is template-driven; this makes it simple to configure both the client and the operator. The configuration options are documented on the link:docs/configuration.asciidoc[Configuration] page.

== Commands

*postgres-operator* commands are documented on the link:docs/commands.asciidoc[Commands] page.

== Building From Source

For people wanting to build from source, instructions are documented on the link:docs/build.asciidoc[Build] page.
