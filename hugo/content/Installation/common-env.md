For various scripts used by the Operator, the `expenv` utility is required as are certain environment variables.

Download the `expenv` utility from its [Github Releases page](https://github.com/blang/expenv/releases), and place it into your PATH (e.g. $HOME/odev/bin).

The following environment variables are heavily used in the Bash installation procedures and may be used in Operator helper scripts.
