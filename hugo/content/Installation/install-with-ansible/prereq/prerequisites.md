# Prerequisites

The following is required prior to installing Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator using Ansible:

* [postgres-operator-playbooks](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator-playbooks) source code for the target version
* Ansible 2.4.6+

## Kubernetes Installs

* Kubernetes v1.11+
* Cluster admin privileges in Kubernetes
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) configured to communicate with Kubernetes

## OpenShift Installs

* OpenShift v3.09+
* Cluster admin privileges in OpenShift
* [oc](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html) configured to communicate with OpenShift

## Installing from a Windows Host

If the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator is being installed from a Windows host the following 
are required:

* [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
* [Ubuntu for Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6)

## Permissions

The installation of the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator requires elevated privileges.  
It is required that the playbooks are run as a `cluster-admin` to ensure the playbooks 
can install:

* Custom Resource Definitions
* Cluster RBAC
* Create required namespaces

## Configuring the Inventory File

The `inventory` file included with the PostgreSQL Operator Playbooks allows installers 
to configure how the operator will function when deployed into Kubernetes.  This file 
should contain all configurable variables the playbooks offer.

The following are the variables available for configuration:

## Storage

Kubernetes and OpenShift offer support for a variety of storage types.  The Crunchy 
PostgreSQL Operator must be configured to utilize the storage options available by 
configuring the `storage` options included in the inventory file.

### Considerations for Multi-Zone Cloud Environments

When using the Operator in a Kubernetes cluster consisting of nodes that span 
multiple zones, special consideration must betaken to ensure all pods and the 
volumes they require are scheduled and provisioned within the same zone.  Specifically,
being that a pod is unable mount a volume that is located in another zone, any 
volumes that are dynamically provisioned must be provisioned in a topology-aware 
manner according to the specific scheduling requirements for the pod. For instance, 
this means ensuring that the volume containing the database files for the primary 
database in a new PostgreSQL cluster is provisioned in the same zone as the node 
containing the PostgreSQL primary pod that will be using it.

For instructions on setting up storage classes for multi-zone environments, see 
the [PostgreSQL Operator Documentation](https://crunchydata.github.io/postgres-operator/stable/design/).

### Examples

The following are examples on configuring the storage variables for different types 
of storage classes.

#### Generic Storage Class

To setup storage1 to use the storage class `fast`

```ini
storage1_access_mode='ReadWriteOnce'
storage1_size='10G'
storage1_type='dynamic'
storage1_class='fast'
```

To assign this storage definition to all `primary` pods created by the Operator, we 
can configure the `primary_storage=storage1` variable in the inventory file.

#### GKE

The storage class provided by Google Kubernetes Environment (GKE) can be configured 
to be used by the Operator by setting the following variables in the `inventory` file:

```ini
storage1_access_mode='ReadWriteOnce'
storage1_size='10G'
storage1_type='dynamic'
storage1_class='standard'
storage1_fs_group=26
```

To assign this storage definition to all `primary` pods created by the Operator, we 
can configure the `primary_storage=storage1` variable in the inventory file.

## Understanding `pgo_namespace` & `target_namespaces`

The Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator can be configured to be deployed and manage a single 
namespace or manage several namespaces.  The following are examples of different types 
of deployment models configurable in the `inventory` file.

### Single Namespace

To deploy the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator to work with a single namespace (in this example 
our namespace is named `pgo`), configure the following `inventory` settings:

```ini
pgo_namespace='pgo'
target_namespaces='pgo'
```

### Multiple Namespaces

To deploy the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator to work with multiple namespaces (in this example
our namespaces are named `pgo`, `pgouser1` and `pgouser2`), configure the following `inventory` settings:

```ini
pgo_namespace='pgo'
target_namespaces='pgouser1,pgouser2'
```

## Deploying Multiple Operators

The 4.0 release of the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator allows for multiple operator deployments in the same cluster.  
To install the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator to multiple namespaces, it's recommended to have an `inventory` file 
for each deployment of the operator.

For each operator deployment the following inventory variables should be configured uniquely for each install.

For example, operator could be deployed twice by changing the `pgo_namespace` and `target_namespaces` for those 
deployments:

Inventory A would deploy operator to the `pgo` namespace and it would manage the `pgo` target namespace.

```init
# Inventory A
pgo_namespace='pgo'
target_namespaces='pgo'
...
```

Inventory B would deploy operator to the `pgo2` namespace and it would manage the `pgo2` and `pgo3` target namespaces.
```init
# Inventory B
pgo_namespace='pgo2'
target_namespaces='pgo2,pgo3'
...
```

Each install of the operator will create a corresponding directory in `$HOME/.pgo/<PGO NAMESPACE>` which will contain 
the TLS and `pgouser` client credentials.

## Deploying Grafana and Prometheus

PostgreSQL clusters created by the operator can be configured to create additional containers for collecting metrics.  
These metrics are very useful for understanding the overall health and performance of PostgreSQL database deployments 
over time.  The collectors included by the operator are:

* Node Exporter - Host metrics where the PostgreSQL containers are running
* PostgreSQL Exporter - PostgreSQL metrics

The operator, however, does not install the neccessary timeseries database (Prometheus) for storing the collected 
metrics or the front end visualization (Grafana) of those metrics.

Included in these playbooks are roles for deploying Granfana and/or Prometheus.  See the `inventory` file 
for options to install the metrics stack.
