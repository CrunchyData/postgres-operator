# Install the Postgres Operator (`pgo`) Client

The following will install and configure the `pgo` client on all systems.  For the
purpose of these instructions it's assumed that the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator
is already deployed.

## Prerequisites

* For Kubernetes deployments: [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) configured to communicate with Kubernetes
* For OpenShift deployments: [oc](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html) configured to communicate with OpenShift

The Crunchy Postgres Operator als requires the following in order to authenticate with the apiserver:

* Client CA Certificate
* Client TLS Certificate
* Client Key
* `pgouser` file containing `<username>:<password>`

All of the requirements above should be obtained from an administrator who installed the Crunchy
PostgreSQL Operator.

## Linux and MacOS

The following will setup the `pgo` client to be used on a Linux or MacOS system.

### Installing the Client

First, download the `pgo` client from the
[GitHub official releases](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator/releases). Crunchy Enterprise Customers can download the pgo binaries from https://access.crunchydata.com/ on the downloads page. 

Next, install `pgo` in `/usr/local/bin` by running the following:

```bash
sudo mv /PATH/TO/pgo /usr/local/bin/pgo
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pgo
```

Verify the `pgo` client is accessible by running the following in the terminal:

```bash
pgo --help
```

#### Configuring Client TLS

With the client TLS requirements satisfied we can setup `pgo` to use them.

First, create a directory to hold these files by running the following command:

```bash
mkdir ${HOME?}/.pgo
chmod 700 ${HOME?}/.pgo
```

Next, copy the certificates to this new directory:

```bash
cp /PATH/TO/client.crt ${HOME?}/.pgo/client.crt && chmod 600 ${HOME?}/.pgo/client.crt
cp /PATH/TO/client.pem ${HOME?}/.pgo/client.pem && chmod 400 ${HOME?}/.pgo/client.pem
```

Finally, set the following environment variables to point to the client TLS files:

```bash
cat <<EOF >> ${HOME?}/.bashrc
export PGO_CA_CERT="${HOME?}/.pgo/client.crt"
export PGO_CLIENT_CERT="${HOME?}/.pgo/client.crt"
export PGO_CLIENT_KEY="${HOME?}/.pgo/client.pem"
EOF
```

Apply those changes to the current session by running:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Configuring `pgouser`

The `pgouser` file contains the username and password used for authentication with the Crunchy
PostgreSQL Operator.

To setup the `pgouser` file, run the following:

```bash
echo "<USERNAME_HERE>:<PASSWORD_HERE>" > ${HOME?}/.pgo/pgouser
```

```bash
cat <<EOF >> ${HOME?}/.bashrc
export PGOUSER="${HOME?}/.pgo/pgouser"
EOF
```

Apply those changes to the current session by running:

```bash
source ${HOME?}/.bashrc
```

#### Configuring the API Server URL

If the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator is not accessible outside of the cluster, it's required
to setup a port-forward tunnel using the `kubectl` or `oc` binary.

In a separate terminal we need to setup a port forward to the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator to
ensure connection can be made outside of the cluster:

```bash
# If deployed to Kubernetes
kubectl port-forward <OPERATOR_POD_NAME> -n <OPERATOR_NAMESPACE> 8443:8443

# If deployed to OpenShift
oc port-forward <OPERATOR_POD_NAME> -n <OPERATOR_NAMESPACE> 8443:8443
```

**Note**: the port-forward will be required for the duration of `pgo` usage.

Next, set the following environment variable to configure the API server address:

```bash
cat <<EOF >> ${HOME?}/.bashrc
export PGO_APISERVER_URL="https://<IP_OF_OPERATOR_API>:8443"
EOF
```

**Note**: if port-forward is being used, the IP of the Operator API is `127.0.0.1`

Apply those changes to the current session by running:

```bash
source ${HOME?}/.bashrc
```

## Windows

The following will setup the `pgo` client to be used on a Windows system.

### Installing the Client

First, download the `pgo.exe` client from the
[GitHub official releases](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator/releases).

Next, create a directory for `pgo` using the following:

* Left click the _Start_ button in the bottom left corner of the taskbar
* Type `cmd` to search for _Command Prompt_
* Right click the _Command Prompt_ application and click "Run as administrator"
* Enter the following command: `mkdir "%ProgramFiles%\postgres-operator"`

Within the same terminal copy the `pgo.exe` binary to the directory created above using the
following command:

```bash
copy %HOMEPATH%\Downloads\pgo.exe "%ProgramFiles%\postgres-operator"
```

Finally, add `pgo.exe` to the system path by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
setx path "%path%;C:\Program Files\postgres-operator"
```

Verify the `pgo.exe` client is accessible by running the following in the terminal:

```bash
pgo --help
```

#### Configuring Client TLS

With the client TLS requirements satisfied we can setup `pgo` to use them.

First, create a directory to hold these files using the following:

* Left click the _Start_ button in the bottom left corner of the taskbar
* Type `cmd` to search for _Command Prompt_
* Right click the _Command Prompt_ application and click "Run as administrator"
* Enter the following command: `mkdir "%HOMEPATH%\pgo"`

Next, copy the certificates to this new directory:

```bash
copy \PATH\TO\client.crt "%HOMEPATH%\pgo"
copy \PATH\TO\client.pem "%HOMEPATH%\pgo"
```

Finally, set the following environment variables to point to the client TLS files:

```bash
setx PGO_CA_CERT "%HOMEPATH%\pgo\client.crt"
setx PGO_CLIENT_CERT "%HOMEPATH%\pgo\client.crt"
setx PGO_CLIENT_KEY "%HOMEPATH%\pgo\client.pem"
```

#### Configuring `pgouser`

The `pgouser` file contains the username and password used for authentication with the Crunchy
PostgreSQL Operator.

To setup the `pgouser` file, run the following:

* Left click the _Start_ button in the bottom left corner of the taskbar
* Type `cmd` to search for _Command Prompt_
* Right click the _Command Prompt_ application and click "Run as administrator"
* Enter the following command: `echo USERNAME_HERE:PASSWORD_HERE > %HOMEPATH%\pgo\pgouser`

Finally, set the following environment variable to point to the `pgouser` file:

```
setx PGOUSER "%HOMEPATH%\pgo\pgouser"
```

#### Configuring the API Server URL

If the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator is not accessible outside of the cluster, it's required
to setup a port-forward tunnel using the `kubectl` or `oc` binary.

In a separate terminal we need to setup a port forward to the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator to
ensure connection can be made outside of the cluster:

```bash
# If deployed to Kubernetes
kubectl port-forward <OPERATOR_POD_NAME> -n <OPERATOR_NAMESPACE> 8443:8443

# If deployed to OpenShift
oc port-forward <OPERATOR_POD_NAME> -n <OPERATOR_NAMESPACE> 8443:8443
```

**Note**: the port-forward will be required for the duration of `pgo` usage.

Next, set the following environment variable to configure the API server address:

* Left click the _Start_ button in the bottom left corner of the taskbar
* Type `cmd` to search for _Command Prompt_
* Right click the _Command Prompt_ application and click "Run as administrator"
* Enter the following command: `setx PGO_APISERVER_URL "https://<IP_OF_OPERATOR_API>:8443"`
  * Note: if port-forward is being used, the IP of the Operator API is `127.0.0.1`

## Verify the Client Installation

After completing all of the steps above we can verify `pgo` is configured
properly by simply running the following:

```bash
pgo version
```

If the above command outputs versions of both the client and API server, the Crunchy PostgreSQL
Operator client has been installed successfully.
