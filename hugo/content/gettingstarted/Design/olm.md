## Operator Lifecycle Management Support

The PostgreSQL Operator supports Red Hat OLM (Operator Lifecycle Manager)
to a degree starting with the PostgreSQL Operator 4.0 release.

The PostgreSQL Operator supports the different deployment models
as documented [here](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/0.12.0/doc/design/operatorgroups.md )

The PostgreSQL Operator is available for download in [OperatorHub.io](https://www.operatorhub.io/operator/postgres-operator.v3.5.0)
