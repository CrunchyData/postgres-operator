## pgo upgrade

Perform an upgrade

### Synopsis

UPGRADE performs an upgrade on a PostgreSQL cluster. For example:

  pgo upgrade mycluster

 This upgrade will update the CCPImageTag of the deployment for the primary and all replicas.
 The running containers are upgraded one at a time, sequentially, in the following order: replicas, backrest-repo, then primary.

 Note: If the PostgreSQL Operator is deployed using OLM, the value of the CCPImageTag is overriden by what is in the RELATED_IMAGE_* environmental variables, e.g. for the PostgreSQL container, it would be the value of RELATED_IMAGE_CRUNCHY_POSTGRES_HA

```
pgo upgrade [flags]
```
