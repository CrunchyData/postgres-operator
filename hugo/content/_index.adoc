== Documentation

Please view the official Crunchy Data PostgreSQL Operator documentation link:https://crunchydata.github.io/postgres-operator/[here]. If you are
interested in contributing or making an update to the documentation, please view the link:https://crunchydata.github.io/postgres-operator/contributing/[Contributing Guidelines].

== What is the Operator?

The *postgres-operator* is a controller that runs within a Kubernetes cluster that provides a means to deploy and manage PostgreSQL clusters.

Use the postgres-operator to -

 * deploy PostgreSQL containers including streaming replication clusters
 * scale up PostgreSQL clusters with extra replicas
 * add pgpool and metrics sidecars to PostgreSQL clusters
 * apply SQL policies to PostgreSQL clusters
 * assign metadata tags to PostgreSQL clusters
 * maintain PostgreSQL users and passwords
 * perform minor and major upgrades to PostgreSQL clusters
 * load simple CSV and JSON files into PostgreSQL clusters
 * perform database backups

== Design

The *postgres-operator* design incorporates the following concepts -

 * adds Custom Resource Definitions for PostgreSQL to Kubernetes
 * adds controller logic that watches events on PostgreSQL resources
 * provides a command line client (*pgo*) and REST API for interfacing with the postgres-operator
 * provides for very customized deployments including container resources, storage configurations, and PostgreSQL custom configurations

More design information is found on the link:https://crunchydata.github.io/postgres-operator/how-it-works/[How It Works] page.

== Requirements

The postgres-operator runs on any Kubernetes and Openshift platform that supports
Custom Resource Definitions.

The Operator project builds and operates with the following containers -

* link:https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/pgo-rmdata/[Remove Data Container]
* link:https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/postgres-operator/[postgres-operator Container]
* link:https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/pgo-apiserver/[apiserver Container]
* link:https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/pgo-load/[file load Container]
* link:https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/pgo-backrest/[backrest interface Container]

This Operator is developed and tested on the following operating systems but is known to run on other operating systems -

* *CentOS 7*
* *RHEL 7*

== Installation

To build and deploy the Operator on your Kubernetes system, follow the instructions documented on the link:https://crunchydata.github.io/postgres-operator/installation/[Installation] page.

If you're seeking to upgrade your existing Operator installation, please visit the link:https://crunchydata.github.io/postgres-operator/installation/upgrading-the-operator/[Upgrading the Operator] page.

== Configuration

The operator is template-driven; this makes it simple to configure both the client and the operator. The configuration options are documented on the link:https://crunchydata.github.io/postgres-operator/installation/configuration/[Configuration] page.

== Getting Started

*postgres-operator* commands are documented on the link:https://crunchydata.github.io/postgres-operator/getting-started/[Getting Started] page.
