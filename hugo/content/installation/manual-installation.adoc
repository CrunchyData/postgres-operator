== Project Structure

First, define the following environment variables in *.bashrc*:
....
export GOPATH=$HOME/odev
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
export CO_NAMESPACE=demo
export CO_CMD=kubectl
export COROOT=$GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata/postgres-operator
export CO_IMAGE_PREFIX=crunchydata
export CO_IMAGE_TAG=centos7-3.0
export CO_BASEOS=centos7
....

To perform an installation of the operator, first create the project structure as follows on your host, here we assume a local directory called *odev* -
....
mkdir -p $HOME/odev/src $HOME/odev/bin $HOME/odev/pkg
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata/
....

Next, get a tagged release of the source code -
....
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata
git clone https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator.git
cd postgres-operator
git checkout 3.0
....

== Installation Prerequsites

To run the operator and the *pgo* client, you will need the following -

 * a running Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster
 * the kubectl or oc clients installed in your PATH and configured to connect to the cluster (e.g. export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf)
 * a Kubernetes namespace created and set to where you want the operator installed. For this install we assume a namespace of *demo* has been created.
....
kubectl create -f examples/demo-namespace.json
kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=demo
kubectl config view | grep namespace
....

[WARNING]
====
If you are not using the *demo* namespace, it will be required to edit the following and change the namespace where the service account and cluster role bindings will be deployed.

`$COROOT/deploy/service-account.yaml`

`$COROOT/deploy/cluster-role-binding.yaml`
====

Permissions are granted to the Operator by means of a Service Account called *postgres-operator*.  That service account is added to the Operator deployment.

The postgres-operator service account is granted cluster-admin priviledges using a cluster role binding *postgres-operator-cluster-role-binding*.

See link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/[here] for more details on how to enable RBAC roles and modify the scope of the permissions to suit your needs.

== Basic Installation

The basic installation uses the default operator configuration settings, these settings assume you want to use HostPath storage on your Kube cluster for database persistence.  Other persistent options are available but require the Advanced Installation below.

=== Create HostPath Directory

The default Persistent Volume script assumes a default HostPath directory be created called */data*:
....
sudo mkdir /data
sudo chown 777 /data
....

Create some sample Persistent Volumes using the following script:
....
go get github.com/blang/expenv
$COROOT/pv/create-pv.sh
....

== Build Images & Deploy

{{%expand "Packaged Images" %}}

=== Packaged Images

To pull prebuilt versions from Dockerhub of the *postgres-operator* containers, execute the following Makefile target -
....
make pull
....

To pull down the prebuilt *pgo* binaries, download the *tar.gz* release file from the following link -

 * link:https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator/releases[Github Releases]
 * extract (e.g. tar xvzf postgres-operator.3.0.tar.gz)
....
cd $HOME
tar xvzf ./postgres-operator.3.0.tar.gz
....
 * copy *pgo* client to somewhere in your path (e.g. cp pgo /usr/local/bin)

Next, deploy the operator to your Kubernetes cluster -
....
cd $COROOT
make deployoperator
....

{{%expand "Build from Source" %}}

=== Build from Source

The purpose of this section is to illustrate how to build the PostgreSQL
Operator from source. These are considered advanced installation steps and
should be primarily used by developers or those wishing a more precise
installation method.

==== Requirements

The postgres-operator runs on any Kubernetes and Openshift platform that supports
Custom Resource Definitions. The Operator is tested on Kubeadm and OpenShift
Container Platform environments.

The operator is developed with the Golang versions greater than or equal to version 1.8. See
link:https://golang.org/dl/[Golang website] for details on installing golang.

The Operator project builds and operates with the following containers -

* link:https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/pgo-lspvc/[PVC Listing Container]
* link:https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/pgo-rmdata/[Remove Data Container]
* link:https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/postgres-operator/[postgres-operator Container]
* link:https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/pgo-apiserver/[apiserver Container]
* link:https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/pgo-load/[file load Container]

This Operator is developed and tested on the following operating systems but is known to run on other operating systems -

* *CentOS 7*
* *RHEL 7*

Before compiling the Operator, it's necessary to install the *Mercurial* requirement.
....
sudo yum -y install mercurial
....

Then, install the project library dependencies. The godep dependency manager is used for this purpose. Then, compile the PostgreSQL Operator using the Makefile and deploy the operator to your Kubernetes cluster.
....
cd $COROOT
make setup
make all
make deployoperator
....
