Latest Release: 3.2.0 {docdate}

== Project Structure

First, define the following environment variables in *.bashrc*:
....
export GOPATH=$HOME/odev
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN
export CO_NAMESPACE=demo
export CO_CMD=kubectl
export COROOT=$GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata/postgres-operator
export CO_IMAGE_PREFIX=crunchydata
export CO_BASEOS=centos7
export CO_VERSION=3.2
export CO_IMAGE_TAG=centos7-$CO_VERSION
export CO_BASEOS=centos7
export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN
export PGO_CA_CERT=$COROOT/conf/apiserver/server.crt
export PGO_CLIENT_CERT=$COROOT/conf/apiserver/server.crt
export PGO_CLIENT_KEY=$COROOT/conf/apiserver/server.key
alias setip='export CO_APISERVER_URL=https://`kubectl get service postgres-operator -o=jsonpath="{.spec.clusterIP}"`:8443'
....

When deploying on Openshift Container Platform, the CO_CMD environment
variable should be:
....
export CO_CMD=oc
....

To perform an installation of the operator, first create the project structure as follows on your host, here we assume a local directory called *odev* -
....
mkdir -p $HOME/odev/src $HOME/odev/bin $HOME/odev/pkg $GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata/
....

Next, get a tagged release of the source code -
....
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/crunchydata
git clone https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator.git
cd postgres-operator
git checkout 3.2.0
....

== Installation Prerequsites

To run the operator and the *pgo* client, you will need the following -

 * a running Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster
 * the kubectl or oc clients installed in your PATH and configured to connect to the cluster (e.g. export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf)
 * a Kubernetes namespace created and set to where you want the operator installed. For this install we assume a namespace of *demo* has been created.
....
kubectl create -f examples/demo-namespace.json
kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=demo
kubectl config view | grep namespace
....

Run the makefile `setup` target to install depedencies and also
create the operator CRD resources and RBAC rules:
....
make setup
....

[WARNING]
====
The namespace used by the operator is determined by the
CO_NAMESPACE environment variable setting.
====

== Basic Installation

The basic installation uses the default operator configuration settings, these settings assume you want to use HostPath storage on your Kube cluster for database persistence.  Other persistent options are available but require the Advanced Installation below.

=== Create HostPath Directory

The default Persistent Volume script assumes a default HostPath directory be created called */data*:
....
sudo mkdir /data
sudo chmod 777 /data
....

Create some sample Persistent Volumes using the following script:
....
$COROOT/pv/create-pv.sh
....

== Build Images & Deploy

{{%expand "Packaged Images" %}}

=== Packaged Images

To pull prebuilt versions from Dockerhub of the *postgres-operator* containers, execute the following Makefile target -
....
make pull
....

To pull down the prebuilt *pgo* binaries, download the *tar.gz* release file from the following link -

 * link:https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator/releases[Github Releases]
 * extract (e.g. tar xvzf postgres-operator.3.2.tar.gz)
....
cd $HOME
tar xvzf ./postgres-operator.3.2.tar.gz
....
 * copy *pgo* client to somewhere in your path (e.g. cp pgo /usr/local/bin)

Next, deploy the operator to your Kubernetes cluster -
....
cd $COROOT
make deployoperator
....

[WARNING]
====
If you make configuration file changes you will need to re-run the
`deployoperator` makefile target to re-deploy the Operator with the
new configuration files.

{{%expand "Build from Source" %}}

=== Build from Source

The purpose of this section is to illustrate how to build the PostgreSQL
Operator from source. These are considered advanced installation steps and
should be primarily used by developers or those wishing a more precise
installation method.

==== Requirements

The postgres-operator runs on any Kubernetes and Openshift platform that supports
Custom Resource Definitions. The Operator is tested on Kubeadm and OpenShift
Container Platform environments.

The operator is developed with the Golang versions greater than or equal to version 1.8. See
link:https://golang.org/dl/[Golang website] for details on installing golang.

The Operator project builds and operates with the following containers -

* link:https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/pgo-lspvc/[PVC Listing Container]
* link:https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/pgo-rmdata/[Remove Data Container]
* link:https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/postgres-operator/[postgres-operator Container]
* link:https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/pgo-apiserver/[apiserver Container]
* link:https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/pgo-load/[file load Container]
* link:https://hub.docker.com/r/crunchydata/pgo-backrest/[pgbackrest interface Container]

This Operator is developed and tested on the following operating systems but is known to run on other operating systems -

* *CentOS 7*
* *RHEL 7*

The following makefile targets will pull down source dependec
....
cd $COROOT
make setup
make all
make deployoperator
....

== Makefile Targets

The following table describes the Makefile targets -

.Makefile Targets
[width="80%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|======================
|Target | Description
|all        | compile all binaries and build all images
|setup        | fetch the dependent packages required to build with, and create Kube RBAC resources
|bounce        | delete the Operator pod only, this is a way to upgrade the operator without a full redeploy, as the operator runs in a Deployment, a new pod will be created to replace the old one, a simple way to bounce the pod
|deployoperator        | deploy the Operator (apiserver and postgers-operator) to Kubernetes
|main        | compile the postgres-operator
|runmain        | locally execute the postgres-operator
|pgo        | build the pgo binary
|runpgo        | run the pgo binary
|runapiserver        | run the apiserver binary outside of Kube
|clean        | remove binaries and compiled packages, restore dependencies
|operatorimage        | compile and build the postgres-operator Docker image
|apiserverimage        | compile and build the apiserver Docker image
|lsimage        | build the lspvc Docker image
|loadimage        | build the file load Docker image
|rmdataimage        | build the data deletion Docker image
|pgo-backrest-image        | build the pgbackrest interface Docker image
|release        | build the postgres-operator release
|======================

== Next Steps

Next, visit the link:/installation/deployment/[Deployment] page to deploy the
Operator, verify the installation, and view various storage configurations.
