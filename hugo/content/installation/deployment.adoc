Latest Release: 3.5.0 {docdate}

This document details verifying the installation of the PostgreSQL Operator
is successful, in addition to detailing some different storage configurations
that can be made.

== Verify Operator Status

To verify that the operator is deployed and running, run the following:
....
kubectl get pod --selector=name=postgres-operator
....

You should see output similar to this:
....
NAME                                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
postgres-operator-56598999cd-tbg4w   2/2       Running   0          1m
....

There are 2 containers in the operator pod, both should be *ready* as above.

When you first run the operator, it will create the required
CustomResourceDefinitions. You can view these as follows -
....
kubectl get crd
....

The operator creates the following Custom Resource Definitions over time as the
associated commands are triggered.
....
kubectl get crd
NAME                             AGE
pgbackups.cr.client-go.k8s.io    2d
pgclusters.cr.client-go.k8s.io   2d
pgpolicies.cr.client-go.k8s.io   2d
pgreplicas.cr.client-go.k8s.io   2d
pgtasks.cr.client-go.k8s.io      2d
pgupgrades.cr.client-go.k8s.io   2d
....

At this point, the server side of the operator is deployed and ready.

== Configure *pgo* Client

The pgo command line client requires TLS for securing the connection to the operator's REST API.  This configuration is performed as follows -
....
export PGO_CA_CERT=$COROOT/conf/postgres-operator/server.crt
export PGO_CLIENT_CERT=$COROOT/conf/postgres-operator/server.crt
export PGO_CLIENT_KEY=$COROOT/conf/postgres-operator/server.key
....

The pgo client uses Basic Authentication to authenticate to the operator REST API. For authentication, add the following `.pgouser` file to your $HOME -
....
echo "username:password" > $HOME/.pgouser
....

Roles are defined in a file called *pgorole*. This file defines each role and the
permissions for that role. By default, two roles are defined as samples -
....
pgoadmin
pgoreader
....

This file, moved to your $HOME folder, is optional. These default settings can be adjusted to meet local 
security requirements.

The format of this file is as follows -
....
rolename: permissionA, permissionB
....

These are defined in the following file -
....
$COROOT/conf/postgres-operator/pgorole
....

The complete set of permissions is documented in the link:/installation/configuration/[Configuration] document.

The *pgo* client needs the URL to connect to the operator.

Depending on your Kubernetes environment this can be done the following ways.

=== Running Kubernetes Locally

If your local host is not set up to resolve Kubernetes Service DNS names, you can specify the operator IP address as follows -
....
kubectl get service postgres-operator
NAME                TYPE       CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
postgres-operator   NodePort   10.109.184.8   <none>        8443:30894/TCP   5m

export CO_APISERVER_URL=https://10.109.184.8:8443
pgo version
....

Alternatively, an alias was set up in the .bashrc file earlier on, as follows:
....
alias setip='export CO_APISERVER_URL=https://`kubectl get service postgres-operator -o=jsonpath="{.spec.clusterIP}"`:8443'
....

This alias (`setip`) will set the `CO_APISERVER_URL` IP address for you.

==== Running Kubernetes Remotely

===== Port forwarding

Set up a port-forward tunnel from your host to the Kube remote host, specifying the operator pod -
....
kubectl get pod --selector=name=postgres-operator
NAME                                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
postgres-operator-56598999cd-tbg4w   2/2       Running   0          8m

kubectl port-forward postgres-operator-56598999cd-tbg4w 8443:8443
....

In another terminal -
....
export CO_APISERVER_URL=https://127.0.0.1:8443
pgo version
....

===== Using an ingress

Ingresses allows you to access Kubernetes services throught a controller.

First you will need to ensure a NGINX Ingress Controller is available in your Kubernetes cluster.

If you are using Minikube, you can easily deploy one using
....
minikube addons enable ingress
....
If not, please refer to the https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#bare-metal[Nginx Ingress Controller's official documentation] for its installation.

Once your controller is running, just deploy the ingress using
....
kubectl create -f $COROOT/deploy/ingress.yml
....
Due to the annotations used, please note this ingress is currently usable only with Nginx Ingress Controller.

Now you can use the adress IP of the host where the nginx-ingress-controller pod is to connect to the pgo apiserver. The port will be 443 (and not 8443).

To retrieve the address ip:
....
kubectl get ingress postgres-operator -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}"

export CO_APISERVER_URL=https://`kubectl get ingress postgres-operator -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}"`
....

If you are using minikube, the address IP displayed is incorrect, just use:
....
minikube ip

export CO_APISERVER_URL=https://`minikube ip`
....

== Verify pgo Client

At this point you should be able to connect to the operator as follows -
....
pgo version
pgo client version 3.4.0
apiserver version 3.4.0
....

Operator commands are documented on the link:/getting-started/[Getting Started] page.

== Next Steps

There are many ways to configure the operator further. Some sample configurations are
documented on the link:/installation/configuration/[Configuration] page.

You may also want to find out more information on how the operator is designed to work and
deploy. This information can be found in the link:/how-it-works/[How It Works] page.

Information can be found on the full scope of commands on the
link:/getting-started/[Getting Started] page.
