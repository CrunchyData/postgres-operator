Latest Release: 3.2.0 {docdate}

== First Steps

Prior to using *pgo*, users will need to specify the
*postgres-operator* URL as follows:
....
kubectl get service postgres-operator
NAME                CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
postgres-operator   10.104.47.110   <none>        8443/TCP   7m
export CO_APISERVER_URL=https://10.104.47.110:8443
pgo version
....

== General

=== Operator Version

This command makes it possible to see what version of the pgo client and
postgres-operator you are running.

==== Syntax

$ pgo version

=== Operator Status

You can use the *pgo status* command to see overall pgo status. Selective
metrics are displayed to provide some insights to the pgo user and administrator
as to what is running currently in this namespace related to pgo.

==== Syntax

$ pgo status [FLAGS]

==== Flags

[width="100%",cols="5,^1,^1, 13",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Name |Shorthand |Input |Usage

|`--output` |-o |String |
The output format. Currently, JSON is supported.
|=========================================================

=== Operator Configuration

The `pgo show config` command displays the running operator configuration
parameters that dictate the setup and user defined configuration of the
operator.  This command can be useful for sharing your configuration or
verifying the setup is as expected.

==== Syntax

$ pgo show config

=== Disk Capacity

The *pgo df* command will let you see the disk capacity of a cluster's PVC
versus that of the PostgreSQL data that has been written to disk. If the capacity
is less than 50%, then the output is printed in red in order to alert the user.

The selector to use for cluster filtering.
|=========================================================

==== Examples

*Cluster Selectors*

The `pgo df` command can either be run against a single cluster or against all
clusters matching a selector:
....
pgo df testcluster
pgo df --selector=project=xrayapp
....

== Cluster Basics

=== Create Cluster

The *create cluster* command will automatically provision a PostgreSQL cluster within
Kubernetes or OpenShift using a Deployment.

|=========================================================

==== Examples

*Simple Creation*

Create a single cluster:
....
pgo create cluster testcluster
....

*Complex Creation*

Create a series of clusters, specifying it as the xray project, with the xrayapp and
rlspolicy policies added:
....
pgo create cluster testcluster --series=3 --labels=project=xray --policies=xrayapp,rlspolicy
....

*Metrics*

Add the
link:https://crunchydata.github.io/crunchy-containers/container-specifications/crunchy-collect/[crunchy-collect]
container from the Crunchy Container Suite to the database cluster pod and enable metrics collection
on the database:
....
pgo create cluster testcluster --metrics
....

You can connect these containers to a metrics pipeline using link:https://grafana.com[Grafana]
and link:https://prometheus.io[Prometheus] by following the example found in the
link:https://crunchydata.github.io/crunchy-containers/getting-started/kubernetes-and-openshift/#_metrics_collection[Crunchy Container Suite documentation].

*Image Version*

New clusters typically pick up the container image version to use
based on the pgo configuration file's `CcpImageTag` setting.  You
can override this value using the ``--ccp-image-tag` command line
flag:
....
pgo create cluster testcluster --ccp-image-tag=centos7-9.6.5-1.6.0
....

*pgPool II*

By appending the `--pgpool` command line flag, you can add
link:http://www.pgpool.net/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page[pgPool II] to the database cluster.
The container used for this functionality is the
link:https://crunchydata.github.io/crunchy-containers/container-specifications/crunchy-pgpool/[crunchy-pgpool]
container image from the Crunchy Container Suite.
....
pgo create cluster testcluster --pgpool
....

*Auto Failover*

To enable *auto failover* on this cluster, use the following flag:
....
pgo create cluster testcluster --autofail
....

This flag, when set on the cluster, informs the operator to look
or watch for NotReady events on this cluster. When those occur, it will
 create a failover state machine which acts as a timer for the cluster.
If the timer expires, then a failover is triggered on the cluster turning
one of the cluster replica pods into the replacement primary pod. See the
link:https://crunchydata.github.io/postgres-operator/how-it-works/[How It Works]
documentation for more details on auto failover.

=== Delete Cluster

The *delete cluster* command will by default delete all associated components of
the selected cluster, but will not delete the data or the backups unless specified.

==== Syntax

$ pgo delete cluster NAME [FLAGS]

==== Flags

[width="100%",cols="5,^1,^1, 13",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Name |Shorthand |Input |Usage

|`--delete-backups` |-b |N/A |
Causes the backups for this cluster to be removed permanently.

|`--delete-data` |-d |N/A |
Causes the data for this cluster to be removed permanently.

|`--no-prompt` |-n |N/A |
No command line confirmation.

|`--selector` |-s |String |
The selector to use for cluster filtering.
|=========================================================

==== Examples

*Simple Deletion*

Create a single cluster:
....
pgo delete cluster testcluster
....

Note that this command will not remove the PVC associated with
this cluster.

*Complex Deletion*

Selectors also apply to the delete command as follows:
....
pgo delete cluster Â --selector=project=xray
....

This command will cause any cluster matching the selector
to be removed.

*Delete Components, Data, & Backups*

You can remove a cluster, it's data files, and all backups by running:
....
pgo delete cluster restoredb --delete-data --delete-backups
....

When you specify a destructive delete like above, you will be prompted
to make sure this is what you want to do.  If you don't want to
be prompted you can enter the `--no-prompt` command line flag.

=== Show Cluster

The `show cluster` command allows you to view all the associated created
components of a specific cluster or selection of clusters.

By default, you will be able to view the status of the created pod, the
PVC, Deployment, Service, and Labels associated with the cluster, and
any and all specified options (such as whether crunchy_collect is enabled).

==== Syntax

$ pgo show cluster NAME [FLAGS]

==== Flags

[width="100%",cols="5,^1,^1, 13",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Name |Shorthand |Input |Usage

|`--output` |-o |String |
The output format. Currently, JSON is supported.

|`--selector` |-s |String |
The selector to use for cluster filtering.

|`--show-secrets` |-x |N/A |
Show the Kubernetes secrets associated with the cluster.

|`--version` |-v |String |
Filter the results based on the PostgreSQL version of the cluster.
|=========================================================

==== Examples

*Simple Display*

Show a single cluster:
....
pgo show cluster testcluster
....

*Show All*

Show all clusters available:
....
pgo show cluster all
....

*Show Secrets*

User credentials are generated through Kubernetes Secrets automatically for the
*testuser*, *primaryuser* and *postgres* accounts. The generated passwords can be viewed
by running the `pgo show cluster` command with the `--show-secrets` flag. More details
are available on user management below.

....
pgo show cluster testcluster --show-secrets
....

*PostgreSQL Version*

Filter the results based on the PostgeSQL version of the cluster with the `--version`
flag:
....
pgo show cluster all --version=9.6.2
....

=== Test Connection

This command will test each service defined for the cluster using
the postgres, primary, and normal user accounts defined for the
cluster.  The cluster credentials are accessed and used to test
the database connections.  The equivalent *psql* command is printed
out as connections are tried, along with the connection status.

==== Syntax

$ pgo test NAME [FLAGS]

==== Flags

[width="100%",cols="5,^1,^1, 13",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Name |Shorthand |Input |Usage

|`--output` |-o |String |
The output format. Currently, JSON is supported.

|`--selector` |-s |String |
The selector to use for cluster filtering.
|=========================================================

==== Examples

*Simple Test*

Test the database connections to a cluster:
....
pgo test testcluster
....

*Complex Test*

Like other commands, you can use the selector to test a series
of clusters or to test all available clusters:
....
pgo test --selector=env=research
pgo test all
....

== Administration

=== Backups

The `backup` command will utilize the link:https://crunchydata.github.io/crunchy-containers/container-specifications/crunchy-backup/[crunchy-backup]
container to execute a full backup against another database container
using the standard pg_basebackup utility that is included with PostgreSQL.

When you request a backup, *pgo* will prompt you if you want
to proceed because this action will delete any existing backup job
for this cluster that might exist. The backup files will still
be left intact but the actual Kubernetes Job will be removed prior
to creating a new Job with the same name.

==== Syntax

$ pgo backup NAME [FLAGS]

==== Flags

[width="100%",cols="5,^1,^1, 13",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Name |Shorthand |Input |Usage

|`--no-prompt` |-n |N/A |
No command line confirmation.

|`--selector` |-s |String |
The selector to use for cluster filtering.

|`--pvc-name` |N/A |String |
The PVC name to use for the backup instead of the default.

|`--storage-config` |N/A |String |
The name of a Storage config in pgo.yaml to use for the cluster storage.
|=========================================================

==== Examples

*Simple Backup*

You can start a backup job for a cluster as follows:
....
pgo backup testcluster
....

*Show Backup*

View the backup and backup status:
....
pgo show backup testcluster
....

*Backup PVC Management*

View the PVC folder and the backups contained therein:

....
pgo show pvc testcluster-backup
pgo show pvc testcluster-backup --pvc-root=testcluster-backups
....

The output from this command is important in that it can let you
copy/paste a backup snapshot path and use it for restoring a database
or essentially cloning a database with an existing backup archive.

For example, to restore a database from a backup archive:
....
pgo create cluster restoredb --backup-path=testcluster-backups/2017-03-27-13-56-49 --backup-pvc=testcluster-backup --secret-from=testcluster
....

This will create a new database called *restoredb* based on the
backup found in *testcluster-backups/2017-03-27-13-56-49* and the
secrets of the *testcluster* cluster.

*Override PVC*

You can override the PVC used by the backup job with the following:
....
pgo backup testcluster --pvc-name=myremotepvc
....

This might be useful for special backup cases such as creating
a backup on a disaster recovery PVC.

*Delete Backup*

To delete a backup enter the following:
....
pgo delete backup testcluster
....

=== Scaling Replicas

When you create a Cluster, you will see in the output a variety of Kubernetes
objects were created including:

 * a Deployment holding the primary PostgreSQL database
 * a Deployment holding the replica PostgreSQL database
 * a service for the primary database
 * a service for the replica databases

Since PostgreSQL is a single-primary database by design, the primary
Deployment is set to a replica count of 1 and it can not scale beyond that.

With PostgreSQL, you can create any n-number of replicas each of which
connect to the primary. This forms a streaming replication PostgreSQL cluster.
The PostgreSQL replicas are read-only whereas the primary is read-write.

==== Syntax

$ pgo scale NAME [FLAGS]

==== Flags

[width="100%",cols="5,^1,^1, 13",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Name |Shorthand |Input |Usage

|`--node-label` |N/A |String |
The node label (key) to use in placing the primary database. If not set, any node is used.

|`--replica-count` |-r |String |
The replica count to apply to the clusters. Defaults to 1.

|`--resources-config` |-r |String |
The name of a container resource configuration in pgo.yaml that holds CPU and memory requests and limits.

|`--storage-config` |N/A |String |
The name of a Storage config in pgo.yaml to use for the cluster storage.
|=========================================================

==== Examples

*Simple Scale*

To create a Postgres replica enter a command such as:
....
pgo scale testcluster
....

The pgo scale command is additive, in that each time you execute
it, another replica is created which is added to the Postgres
cluster.

*Testing Replication*

There are 2 service connections available to the PostgreSQL cluster. One is
to the primary database which allows read-write SQL processing, and
the other is to the set of read-only replica databases.  The replica
service performs round-robin load balancing to the replica databases.

You can connect to the primary database and verify that it is replicating
to the replica databases as follows:
....
psql -h 10.107.180.159 -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'
....

*Specifying Nodes*

The scale command will let you specify a `--node-label` flag which
can be used to influence what Kube node the replica will be scheduled
upon.

....
pgo scale testcluster --node-label=speed=fast
....

If you don't specify a `--node-label` flag, a node affinity
rule of *NotIn* will be specified to *prefer* that the replica
be schedule on a node that the primary is not running on.

*Overriding Storage Defaults*

You can also dictate what container resource and storage configurations
will be used for a replica by passing in extra command flags:
....
pgo scale testcluster --storage-config=storage1 --resources-config=small
....

=== Manual Failover

Starting with Release 2.6, there is a manual failover command which
can be used to promote a replica to a primary role in a PostgreSQL
cluster.

This process includes the following actions:

 * pick a target replica to become the new primary
 * delete the current primary deployment to avoid user requests from
   going to multiple primary databases (split brain)
 * promote the targeted replica using *pg_ctl promote*, this will
   cause PostgreSQL to go into read-write mode
 * re-label the targeted replica to use the primary labels, this
   will match the primary service selector and cause new requests
   to the primary to be routed to the new primary (targeted replica)

==== Syntax

$ pgo failover NAME [FLAGS]

==== Flags

[width="100%",cols="5,^1,^1, 13",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Name |Shorthand |Input |Usage

|`--no-prompt` |-n |N/A |
No command line confirmation.

|`--query` |N/A |N/A |
Prints the list of failover candidates.

|`--target` |N/A |String |
The replica target which the failover will occur on.
|=========================================================

==== Examples

*Manual Failover*

The command works like this:
....
pgo failover testcluster --query
....

That command will show you a list of replica targets you can choose
to failover to.  You will select one of those for the following
command:
....
pgo failover testcluster --target=testcluster-abxq
....

There is a CRD called *pgtask* that will hold the failover request
and also the status of that request.  You can view the status
by viewing it:
....
kubectl get pgtasks testcluster-failover -o yaml
....

Once completed, you will see a new replica has been started to replace
the promoted replica, which happens automatically due to the re-label. The
Deployment will recreate its pod because of this.  The failover typically
takes only a few seconds, however, the creation of the replacement
replica can take longer depending on how much data is being replicated.

=== Upgrading PostgreSQL

The *upgrade* command will allow you to upgrade the PostgreSQL version of
your cluster with the pg_upgrade utility. Minor or major upgrades are
supported. The Crunchy Container Suite
link:https://crunchydata.github.io/crunchy-containers/container-specifications/crunchy-upgrade/[crunchy-upgrade]
container is responsible for performing this task.

By default, it will request confirmation for the command as the operator
deletes the existing contaniers of the database or cluster and recreates
them using the currently defined PostgreSQL contaner image specified in the
pgo.yaml configuration file or with a defined `--ccp-image-tag` flag.
The database data files remain untouched throughout the upgrade.

Once the upgrade job is completed, the operator will create the original
database or cluster container mounted with the new PVC which contains the
upgraded database files.

As the upgrade is processed, the status of the *pgupgrade* CRD is updated to
give the user some insight into how the upgrade is proceeding. Upgrades like
this can take a long time if your database is large. The operator creates a
watch on the upgrade job to know when and how to proceed.

==== Syntax

$ pgo upgrade NAME [FLAGS]

==== Flags

[width="100%",cols="5,^1,^1, 13",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Name |Shorthand |Input |Usage

|`--ccp-image-tag` |-c |String |
The CCPImageTag to use for cluster creation. If specified, overrides the pgo.yaml setting.

|`--upgrade-type` |-t |String |
The upgrade type. Accepted values are either "minor" or "major", with the default being "minor".
|=========================================================

==== Examples

*Minor Upgrade*

Perform a minor PostgreSQL version upgrade:
....
pgo upgrade testcluster
....

*Major Upgrade*

Perform a major PostgreSQL version upgrade:
....
pgo upgrade testcluster --upgrade-type=major
....

*Overriding Version*

Override the `CcpImageTag` variable defined in the pgo.yaml configuration file:
....
pgo upgrade testcluster --ccp-image-tag=centos7-9.6.9-1.8.3
pgo upgrade testcluster --upgrade-type=major --ccp-image-tag=centos7-9.6.9-1.8.3
....

*Delete Upgrade*

To remove an upgrade CRD, issue the following:
....
pgo delete upgrade
....

=== Labels

Labels can be applied to clusters and nested according to their type, with any string
input being valid.

==== Syntax

$ pgo label [NAME] [FLAGS]

==== Flags

[width="100%",cols="5,^1,^1, 13",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Name |Shorthand |Input |Usage

|`--delete-label` |-x |String |
Deletes a label from specified clusters.

|`--dry-run` |-d |N/A |
Shows the clusters that the label would be applied to, without labelling them.

|`--label` |-l |String |
The new label to apply for any selected or specified clusters.

|`--selector` |-s |String |
The selector to use for cluster filtering.
|=========================================================

==== Examples

*Applying Labels*

You can apply a user defined label to a cluster as follows:
....
pgo label testcluster --label=env=research
....

Or if you wanted to apply if to a selection of clusters:
....
pgo label --label=env=research Â --selector=project=xray
....

In the first example, a label of *env=research* is applied to the cluster
*testcluster*. The second example will apply the label to any clusters that
have an existing label of *project=xray* applied.

=== Creating SQL Policies

Policies are SQL files that can be applied to a single cluster, a selection
of clusters, or to all newly created clusters by default.

They are automatically applied to any cluster you create if
you define in your *pgo.yaml* configuration a CLUSTER.POLICIES
value.

{{% notice warning %}}
Policies are executed as the superuser or *postgres* user in
PostgreSQL. These should therefore be exercised with caution.
{{% /notice %}}

==== Syntax

$ pgo create policy [NAME] [FLAGS]

==== Flags

[width="100%",cols="5,^1,^1, 13",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Name |Shorthand |Input |Usage

|`--in-file` |-i |String |
The policy file path to use for adding a policy.

|`--url` |-u |N/A |
The url to use for adding a policy.
|=========================================================

==== Examples

*Creating Policies*

To create a policy use the following syntax:
....
pgo create policy policy1 --in-file=/tmp/policy1.sql
pgo create policy policy1 --url=https://someurl/policy1.sql
....

When you execute this command, it will create a policy named *policy1*
using the input file */tmp/policy1.sql* as input.  It will create
on the server a PgPolicy CRD with the name *policy1* that you can
examine as follows:
....
kubectl get pgpolicies policy1 -o json
....

*Apply Policies*

To apply an existing policy to a set of clusters, issue
a command like this:
....
pgo apply policy1 --selector=name=testcluster
....

When you execute this command, it will look up clusters that
have a label value of `name=testcluster` and then it will apply
the *policy1* label to that cluster and execute the policy
SQL against that cluster using the *postgres* user account.

*Testing Policy Application*

You can apply policies with a `--dry-run` flag applied to test
which clusters the policy would be applied to without actually
executing the SQL:
....
pgo apply policy1 --dry-run --selector=name=testcluster
....

*Show Policies*

To view all policies:
....
pgo show policy all
....

*Show Clusters with a Specified Policy Applied*

If you want to view the clusters than have a specific policy applied
to them, you can use the `--selector` flag as follows to filter on a
policy name (e.g. policy1):
....
pgo show cluster --selector=policy1=pgpolicy
....

*Delete Policies*

To delete a policy use the following form:
....
pgo delete policy policy1
....

=== Loading Data

A CSV file loading capability is supported. This can be tested through
creating a SQL Policy which will create a database table that will be
loaded with the CSV data. The loading is based on a load definition found
in the `sample-load-config.json` file. In that file, the data to be loaded
is specified. When the `pgo load` command is executed, Jobs will be created
to perform the loading for each cluster that matches the selector filter.

The load configuration file has the following YAML attributes:

[width="100%",cols="m,2",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|======================
|Attribute | Description
|COImagePrefix|  the pgo-load image prefix to use for the load job
|COImageTag|  the pgo-load image tag to use for the load job
|DbDatabase|  the database schema to use for loading the data
|DbUser|  the database user to use for loading the data
|DbPort|  the database port of the database to load
|TableToLoad|  the PostgreSQL table to load
|FilePath|  the name of the file to be loaded
|FileType|  either csv or json, determines the type of data to be loaded
|PVCName|  the name of the PVC that holds the data file to be loaded
|SecurityContext| either fsGroup or SupplementalGroup values
|======================

==== Syntax

$ pgo load [FLAGS]

==== Flags

[width="100%",cols="5,^1,^1, 13",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Name |Shorthand |Input |Usage

|`--load-config` |-l |String |
The load configuration to use that defines the load job.

|`--policies` |-z |String |
The policies to apply before loading a file, comma separated.

|`--selector` |-s |String |
The selector to use for cluster filtering.
|=========================================================

==== Examples

*Loading CSV Files*

Load a sample CSV file into a database as follows:
....
pgo load --load-config=$COROOT/examples/sample-load-config.json  --selector=name=testcluster
....

*Including Policies*

If you include the *--policies* flag, any specified policies will be applied prior to the data being loaded.  For
example:
....
pgo load --policies="rlspolicy,xrayapp" --load-config=$COROOT/examples/sample-load-config.json --selector=name=testcluster
....

== Authentication

=== Credential Management

The `pgo user`, `pgo create user`, and `pgo delete user` commands are used to manage
credentials for the PostgreSQL clusters.

==== Syntax

$ pgo user [FLAGS]

==== Flags

[width="100%",cols="5,^1,^1, 13",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Name |Shorthand |Input |Usage

|`--change-password` |-c |String |
Updates the password for a user on selective clusters.

|`--db` |-b |String |
Grants the user access to a database.

|`--expired` |-e |String |
Shows passwords that will expire in X days.

|`--managed` |-m |N/A |
Creates a user with secrets that can be managed by the Operator.

|`--selector` |-s |String |
The selector to use for cluster filtering.

|`--update-passwords` |-u |N/A |
Performs password updating on expired passwords.

|`--valid-days` |-v |Int |
Sets passwords for new users to X days (default 30).
|=========================================================

==== Examples

*Basic User Creation*

To create a new Postgres user assigned to the *testcluster* cluster, execute:
....
pgo create user sally --selector=name=testcluster
....

*Managed User Creation*

To create a new Postgres user to the *testcluster* cluster that has credentials created with Kubernetes Secrets, use the *--managed* flag:
....
pgo create user sally --managed --selector=name=testcluster
....

A *managed* account is one that the Operator can manipulate as well; this means that when you run `pgo show cluster testcluster --show-secrets`
their credentials are visible, when you run `pgo test testcluster` the account is tested with the other default accounts, etc.

*Complex User Creation*

In this example, a user named *user1* is created with a *valid until* password date
set to expire in 30 days.  That user will be granted access to the *userdb* database.
This user account also will have an associated *Secret* created to hold the password
that was generated for this user. Any clusters that match the selector value will
have this user created on it.
....
pgo create user user1 --valid-days=30 --db=userdb --selector=name=xraydb1
....

*Deleting Users*

To delete a Postgres user in the *testcluster* cluster, execute:
....
pgo delete user sally --selector=name=testcluster
....

*Change Password*

To change the password for a user in the *testcluster* cluster:
....
pgo user --change-password=sally --selector=name=testcluster
....

Or to change the password and set an expiration date:
....
pgo user --change-password=user1 --valid-days=10 --selector=name=xray1
....

In this example, a user named *user1* has its password changed to a generated
value and the *valid until* expiration date set to 10 days from now. This
command will take effect across all clusters that match the selector. If you
specify *valid-days=-1* it will mean the password will not expire (e.g. infinity).

*Viewing Expired Passwords*

To see user passwords that have expired past a certain number
of days in the *testcluster* cluster:
....
pgo user --expired=7 --selector=name=testcluster
....

*Updating Expired Passwords*

To update expired passwords in a cluster:
....
pgo user --update-passwords --selector=name=testcluster
....
