== pgo Commands

Prior to using *pgo*, users will need to specify the
*postgres-operator* URL as follows:
....
kubectl get service postgres-operator
NAME                CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
postgres-operator   10.104.47.110   <none>        8443/TCP   7m
export CO_APISERVER_URL=https://10.104.47.110:8443
pgo version
....

=== pgo version

To see what version of pgo client and postgres-operator you are
running, use the following -
....
pgo version
....

=== pgo create cluster

To create a database, use the following -
....
pgo create cluster mycluster
....

A more complex example is to create a *series* of clusters such
as -
....
pgo create cluster xraydb --series=3 --labels=project=xray --policies=xrayapp,rlspolicy
....

In the example above, we provision 3 clusters that have a number appended
into their resulting cluster name, apply a user defined label to each
cluster, and also apply user defined policies to each cluster after
they are created.

You can then view that database as -
....
pgo show cluster mycluster
....

Also, if you like to see JSON formatted output, add the *-o json* flag -
....
pgo show cluster mycluster -o json
....

The output will give you the current status of the database pod
and the IP address of the database service.  If you have *psql*
installed on your test system you can connect to the
database using the service IP address -
....
psql -h 10.105.121.12 -U postgres postgres
....

{{% notice tip %}}
User credentials are generated through Kubernetes Secrets automatically for the
*testuser*, *primaryuser* and *postgres* accounts. The generated passwords can be viewed
by running the `pgo show cluster` command with the `--show-secrets` flag. More details
are available on user management below.
{{% /notice %}}

You can view *all* databases using the special keyword *all* -
....
pgo show cluster all
....

You can filter the results based on the Postgres Version -
....
pgo show cluster all --version=9.6.2
....

You can also add metrics collection to a cluster by using the *--metrics*
command flag as follows -
....
pgo create cluster testcluster --metrics
....

This command flag causes a *crunchy-collect* container to be added to the
database cluster pod and enables metrics collection on that database pod.
For this to work, you will need to configure the Crunchy metrics
example as found in the Crunchy Container Suite.

New clusters typically pick up the container image version to use
based on the pgo configuration file's `CCP_IMAGE_TAG` setting.  You
can override this value using the *--ccp-image-tag* command line
flag -
....
pgo create cluster mycluster --ccp-image-tag=centos7-9.6.5-1.6.0
....

You can also add a pgpool deployment into a cluster by using the *--pgpool*
command flag as follows:
....
pgo create cluster testcluster --pgpool
....

This will cause a *crunchy-pgpool* container to be started and initially
configured for a cluster and the *testuser* cluster credential.  See
below for more details on running a pgpool deployment as part of
your cluster.

You can also enable archive logging into a dedicated PVC by using the *--archive* command flag as follows:
....
pgo create cluster testcluster --archive
....

This will cause a new PVC to be created to hold archive logs.  Space
is consumed by these logs but archives enable you to perform Point-In-Time-Recovery.

To enable *auto failover* on this cluster, use the following flag:
....
pgo create cluster testcluster --autofail
....

*auto failover* when set on the cluster informs the operator to look
or watch for *NotReady* events on this cluster, and when those occur
to create a failover state machine which acts as a timer for the cluster.
If the timer expires, then a failover is triggered on the cluster turning
one of the cluster replica pods into the replacement primary pod.  See
the How It Works documentation for more details on *auto failover*.

=== pgo backup

You can start a backup job for a cluster as follows:
....
pgo backup mycluster
....

You can view the backup:
....
pgo show backup mycluster
....

View the PVC folder and the backups contained therein:

....
pgo show pvc mycluster-backup
pgo show pvc mycluster-backup --pvc-root=mycluster-backups
....

The output from this command is important in that it can let you
copy/paste a backup snapshot path and use it for restoring a database
or essentially cloning a database with an existing backup archive.

For example, to restore a database from a backup archive:
....
pgo create cluster restoredb --backup-path=mycluster-backups/2017-03-27-13-56-49 --backup-pvc=mycluster-backup --secret-from=mycluster
....

This will create a new database called *restoredb* based on the
backup found in *mycluster-backups/2017-03-27-13-56-49* and the
secrets of the *mycluster* cluster.

Selectors can be used to perform backups as well, for example:
....
pgo backup  --selector=project=xray
....

In this example, any cluster that matches the selector will cause
a backup job to be created.

When you request a backup, *pgo* will prompt you if you want
to proceed because this action will delete any existing backup job
for this cluster that might exist.  The backup files will still
be left intact but the actual Kubernetes Job will be removed prior
to creating a new Job with the same name.

You can override the PVC used by the backup job with the following:
....
pgo backup mycluster --pvc-name=myremotepvc
....

This might be useful for special backup cases, perhaps to create
a backup on a disaster recovery PVC.

=== pgo delete backup

To delete a backup enter the following:
....
pgo delete backup mycluster
....

=== pgo delete cluster

You can remove a cluster by running:
....
pgo delete cluster restoredb
....

Note, that this command will not remove the PVC associated with
this cluster.

Selectors also apply to the delete command as follows:
....
pgo delete cluster  --selector=project=xray
....

This command will cause any cluster matching the selector
to be removed.

You can remove a cluster and it's data files by running:
....
pgo delete cluster restoredb --delete-data
....

You can remove a cluster, it's data files, and all backups by running:
....
pgo delete cluster restoredb --delete-data --delete-backups
....

When you specify a destructive delete like above, you will be prompted
to make sure this is what you want to do.  If you don't want to
be prompted you can enter the *--no-prompt* command line flag.


=== pgo scale

When you create a Cluster, you will see in the output a variety of Kubernetes objects were created including:

 * a Deployment holding the primary PostgreSQL database
 * a Deployment holding the replica PostgreSQL database
 * a service for the primary database
 * a service for the replica databases

Since Postgres is a single-primary database by design, the primary
Deployment is set to a replica count of 1, it can not scale beyond 1.

With Postgres, you can any n-number of replicas each of which
connect to the primary forming a streaming replication postgres cluster.
The Postgres replicas are read-only, whereas the primary is read-write.
To create a Postgres replica enter a command such as:
....
pgo scale mycluster
....

The *pgo scale* command is additive, in that each time you execute
it, it will create another replica which is added to the Postgres
cluster.

There are 2 service connections available to the PostgreSQL cluster. One is
to the primary database which allows read-write SQL processing, and
the other is to the set of read-only replica databases.  The replica
service performs round-robin load balancing to the replica databases.

You can connect to the primary database and verify that it is replicating
to the replica databases as follows:
....
psql -h 10.107.180.159 -U postgres postgres -c 'table pg_stat_replication'
....

You can view *all* clusters using the special keyword *all*:
....
pgo show cluster all
....

You can filter the results by Postgres version:
....
pgo show cluster all --version=9.6.2
....

The scale command will let you specify a *--node-label* flag which
can be used to influence what Kube node the replica will be scheduled
upon.

....
pgo scale mycluster --node-label=speed=fast
....

If you don't specify a *--node-label* flag, a node affinity
rule of *NotIn* will be specified to *prefer* that the replica
be schedule on a node that the primary is not running on.

You can also dictate what container resource and storage configurations
will be used for a replica by passing in extra command flags:
....
pgo scale mycluster --storage-config=storage1 --resources-config=small
....

=== pgo upgrade

You can perform a minor Postgres version upgrade
of either a database or cluster as follows:
....
pgo upgrade mycluster
....

When you run this command, it will cause the operator
to delete the existing containers of the database or cluster
and recreate them using the currently defined Postgres
container image specified in your pgo configuration file.

The database data files remain untouched, only the container
is updated, this will upgrade your Postgres server version only.

You can perform a major Postgres version upgrade
of either a database or cluster as follows:
....
pgo upgrade mycluster --upgrade-type=major
....

When you run this command, it will cause the operator
to delete the existing containers of the database or cluster
and recreate them using the currently defined Postgres
container image specified in your pgo configuration file.

The database data files are converted to the new major Postgres
version as specified by the current Postgres image version
in your pgo configuration file.

In this scenario, the upgrade is performed by the Postgres
pg_upgrade utility which is containerized in the *crunchydata/crunchy-upgrade*
container.  The operator will create a Job which runs the upgrade container,
using the existing Postgres database files as input, and output
the updated database files to a new PVC.

Once the upgrade job is completed, the operator will create the
original database or cluster container mounted with the new PVC
which contains the upgraded database files.

As the upgrade is processed, the status of the *pgupgrade* CRD is
updated to give the user some insight into how the upgrade is
proceeding.  Upgrades like this can take a long time if your
database is large.  The operator creates a watch on the upgrade
job to know when and how to proceed.

Likewise, you can upgrade the cluster using a command line flag:
....
pgo upgrade mycluster --ccp-image-tag=centos7-9.6.9-1.8.3
pgo upgrade mycluster --upgrade-type=major --ccp-image-tag=centos7-9.6.9-1.8.3
....


=== pgo delete upgrade

To remove an upgrade CRD, issue the following:
....
pgo delete upgrade
....

=== pgo show pvc

You can view the files on a PVC as follows:
....
pgo show pvc mycluster
....

In this example, the PVC is *mycluster*.  This command is useful
in some cases to examine what files are on a given PVC.

In the case where you want to list a specific path on a PVC
you can specify the path option as follows:
....
pgo show pvc mycluster --pvc-root=mycluster-backups
....

You can also list all PVCs that are created by the operator
using:
....
pgo show pvc all
....


=== pgo show cluster

You can view the passwords used by the cluster as follows:
....
pgo show cluster mycluster --show-secrets=true
....

Passwords are generated if not specified in your *pgo* configuration.

=== pgo test

You can test the database connections to a cluster:
....
pgo test mycluster
....

This command will test each service defined for the cluster using
the postgres, primary, and normal user accounts defined for the
cluster.  The cluster credentials are accessed and used to test
the database connections.  The equivalent *psql* command is printed
out as connections are tried, along with the connection status.

Like other commands, you can use the selector to test a series
of clusters:
....
pgo test --selector=env=research
pgo test all
....

You can get output using the *--output* flag:
....
pgo test all -o json
....

=== pgo create policy

To create a policy use the following syntax:
....
pgo create policy policy1 --in-file=/tmp/policy1.sql
pgo create policy policy1 --url=https://someurl/policy1.sql
....

When you execute this command, it will create a policy named *policy1*
using the input file */tmp/policy1.sql* as input.  It will create
on the server a PgPolicy CRD with the name *policy1* that you can
examine as follows:

....
kubectl get pgpolicies policy1 -o json
....

Policies get automatically applied to any cluster you create if
you define in your *pgo.yaml* configuration a CLUSTER.POLICIES
value.  Policy SQL is executed as the *postgres* user.

To view policies:
....
pgo show policy all
....

=== pgo delete policy

To delete a policy use the following form:
....
pgo delete policy policy1
....

=== pgo apply

To apply an existing policy to a set of clusters, issue
a command like this:
....
pgo apply policy1 --selector=name=mycluster
....

When you execute this command, it will look up clusters that
have a label value of *name=mycluster* and then it will apply
the *policy1* label to that cluster and execute the policy
SQL against that cluster using the *postgres* user account.

{{% notice warning %}}
Policies are executed as the superuser or *postgres* user in
PostgreSQL. These should therefore be exercised with caution.
{{% /notice %}}

If you want to view the clusters than have a specific policy applied
to them, you can use the *--selector* flag as follows to filter on a
policy name (e.g. policy1):
....
pgo show cluster --selector=policy1=pgpolicy
....


=== pgo user

To create a new Postgres user to the *mycluster* cluster, execute:
....
pgo create user sally --selector=name=mycluster
....

To delete a Postgres user in the *mycluster* cluster, execute:
....
pgo user delete user sally --selector=name=mycluster
....

To change the password for a user in the *mycluster* cluster:
....
pgo user --change-password=sally --selector=name=mycluster
....

The password is generated and applied to the user sally.

To see user passwords that have expired past a certain number
of days in the *mycluster* cluster:
....
pgo user --expired=7 --selector=name=mycluster
....

To assign users to a cluster:
....
pgo create user user1 --valid-days=30 --managed --db=userdb --selector=name=xraydb1
....

In this example, a user named *user1* is created with a *valid until* password date set to expire in 30 days.  That user will be granted access to the *userdb* database.  This user account also will have an associated *secret* created to hold the password that was generated for this user.  Any clusters that match the selector value will have this user created on it.

To change a user password:
....
pgo user --change-password=user1 --valid-days=10 --selector=name=xray1
....

In this example, a user named *user1* has its password changed to a generated
value and the *valid until* expiration date set to 10 days from now, this
command will take effect across all clusters that match the selector.  If you
specify *valid-days=-1* it will mean the password will not expire (e.g. infinity).

To see which passwords are set to expire in a given number of days:
....
pgo user --expired=10  --selector=project=xray
....

In this example, any clusters that match the selector are queried to see
if any users are set to expire in 10 days.

To update expired passwords in a cluster:
....
pgo user --update-passwords --selector=name=mycluster
....

=== pgo label

You can apply a user defined label to a cluster as follows:
....
pgo label --label=env=research  --selector=project=xray
....

In this example, we apply a label of *env=research* to any
clusters that have an existing label of *project=xray* applied.

=== pgo load

A CSV file loading capability is supported currently.  You can
test that by creating a SQL Policy which will create a database
table that will be loaded with the CSV data.  For example:

....
pgo create policy xrayapp --in-file=$COROOT/examples/policy/xrayapp.sql
....

Then you can load a sample CSV file into a database as follows:

....
pgo load --load-config=$COROOT/examples/sample-load-config.json  --selector=name=mycluster
....

The loading is based on a load definition found in the *sample-load-config.json* file.  In that file, the data to be loaded is specified. When the *pgo load* command is executed, Jobs will be created to perform the loading for each cluster that matches the selector filter.

If you include the *--policies* flag, any specified policies will be applied prior to the data being loaded.  For
example:
....
pgo load --policies="rlspolicy,xrayapp" --load-config=$COROOT/examples/sample-load-config.json --selector=name=mycluster
....

Likewise you can load a sample json file into a database as follows:
....
pgo load --policies=jsonload --load-config=$COROOT/examples/sample-json-load-config.json  --selector=name=mycluster
....

The load configuration file has the following YAML attributes:

.Load Configuration File Definitions
[width="90%",cols="m,2",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|======================
|Attribute | Description
|COImagePrefix|  the pgo-load image prefix to use for the load job
|COImageTag|  the pgo-load image tag to use for the load job
|DbDatabase|  the database schema to use for loading the data
|DbUser|  the database user to use for loading the data
|DbPort|  the database port of the database to load
|TableToLoad|  the PostgreSQL table to load
|FilePath|  the name of the file to be loaded
|FileType|  either csv or json, determines the type of data to be loaded
|PVCName|  the name of the PVC that holds the data file to be loaded
|SecurityContext| either fsGroup or SupplementalGroup values
|======================

=== pgo failover

Starting with Release 2.6, there is a manual failover command which
can be used to promote a replica to a primary role in a PostgreSQL
cluster.

This process includes the following actions:

 * pick a target replica to become the new primary
 * delete the current primary deployment to avoid user requests from
   going to multiple primary databases (split brain)
 * promote the targeted replica using *pg_ctl promote*, this will
   cause PostgreSQL to go into read-write mode
 * re-label the targeted replica to use the primary labels, this
   will match the primary service selector and cause new requests
   to the primary to be routed to the new primary (targeted replica)

The command works like this:
....
pgo failover mycluster --query
....

That command will show you a list of replica targets you can choose
to failover to.  You will select one of those for the following
command:
....
pgo failover mycluster --target=mycluster-abxq
....

There is a CRD called *pgtask* that will hold the failover request
and also the status of that request.  You can view the status
by viewing it:
....
kubectl get pgtasks mycluster-failover -o yaml
....

Once completed, you will see a new replica has been started to replace
the promoted replica, this happens automatically due to the re-lable, the
Deployment will recreate its pod because of this.   The failover typically
takes only a few seconds, however, the creation of the replacement
replica can take longer depending on how much data is being replicated.

=== pgo df

You can use the *pgo df* command to see the disk capacity of a cluster's PVC
versus that of the PostgreSQL data that has been written to disk.  If
the capacity is less than 50% then the output is printed in red to
alert the user.

Run the command as follows:
....
pgo df mycluster
pgo df --selector=name=mycluster
pgo df --selector=name=hang
CLUSTER             STATUS    PGSIZE    CAPACITY  PCTUSED

mycluster           up        30 MB     1Gi       2
....

=== pgo status

You can use the *pgo status* command to see overall pgo status.  Selective
metrics are displayed to provide some insights to the pgo user and administrator as to what is running currently in this namespace related to pgo.

Run the command as follows:
....
pgo status
