# Generate a Kustomize patch file for removing any TODOs we inherit from the Kubernetes API.
# Right now there is one TODO in our CRD. This script focuses on removing the specific TODO
# anywhere they are found in the CRD.

# The TODO comes from the following:
# https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/25b7aa9e86de7bba38c35cbe56701d2c1ff207e9/core/v1/types.go#L5609
# Additionally, the hope is that this step can be removed once the following issue is addressed
# in the kubebuilder controller-tools project:
# https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools/issues/649
