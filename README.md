# Run Cloud Native PostgreSQL on Kubernetes with PGO: The Postgres Operator from Crunchy Data!

[PGO][documentation], the [Postgres Operator][documentation] developed by
[Crunchy Data](https://crunchydata.com/) and included in [Crunchy PostgreSQL for Kubernetes](https://www.crunchydata.com/products/crunchy-postgresql-for-kubernetes/), automates and simplifies deploying and managing open source
PostgreSQL clusters on Kubernetes.

Whether you need to get a simple Postgres cluster up and running, need to deploy
a high availability, fault tolerant cluster in production, or are running your
own database-as-a-service, the PostgreSQL Operator provides the essential
features you need to keep your cloud native Postgres clusters healthy, including:

#### Postgres Cluster [Provisioning][provisioning]

[Create, Scale, & Delete PostgreSQL clusters with ease][provisioning], while fully customizing your
Pods and PostgreSQL configuration!

#### [High Availability][high-availability]

Safe, automated failover backed by a [distributed consensus based high-availability solution][high-availability].
Uses [Pod Anti-Affinity][k8s-anti-affinity] to help resiliency; you can configure how aggressive this can be!
Failed primaries automatically heal, allowing for faster recovery time.

Support for [standby PostgreSQL clusters][multiple-cluster] that work both within and across [multiple Kubernetes clusters][multiple-cluster].

#### [Disaster Recovery][disaster-recovery]

Backups and restores leverage the open source [pgBackRest][] utility and
[includes support for full, incremental, and differential backups as well as efficient delta restores][disaster-recovery].
Set how long you want your backups retained for. Works great with very large databases!

#### TLS

Secure communication between your applications and data servers by [enabling TLS for your PostgreSQL servers][pgo-task-tls],
including the ability to enforce all of your connections to use TLS.

#### [Monitoring][monitoring]

[Track the health of your PostgreSQL clusters][monitoring] using the open source [pgMonitor][] library.

#### PostgreSQL User Management

Quickly add and remove users from your PostgreSQL clusters with powerful commands. Manage password
expiration policies or use your preferred PostgreSQL authentication scheme.

#### Upgrade Management

Safely apply PostgreSQL updates with minimal availability impact to your PostgreSQL clusters.

#### Advanced Replication Support

Choose between [asynchronous replication][high-availability] and [synchronous replication][high-availability-sync]
for workloads that are sensitive to losing transactions.

#### Clone

Create new clusters from your existing clusters or backups with [`pgo create cluster --restore-from`][pgo-create-cluster].

#### Connection Pooling

Use [pgBouncer][] for connection pooling

#### Affinity and Tolerations

Have your PostgreSQL clusters deployed to [Kubernetes Nodes][k8s-nodes] of your preference with [node affinity][high-availability-node-affinity], or designate which nodes Kubernetes can schedule PostgreSQL instances to with Kubernetes [tolerations][high-availability-tolerations].

#### Scheduled Backups

Choose the type of backup (full, incremental, differential) and [how frequently you want it to occur][disaster-recovery-scheduling] on each PostgreSQL cluster.

#### Backup to S3 or GCS

[Store your backups in Amazon S3][disaster-recovery-s3], any object storage system that supports
the S3 protocol, or [GCS][disaster-recovery-gcs]. The PostgreSQL Operator can backup, restore, and create new clusters from these backups.

#### Multi-Namespace Support

You can control how PGO, the Postgres Operator, leverages [Kubernetes Namespaces][k8s-namespaces] with several different deployment models:

- Deploy PGO and all PostgreSQL clusters to the same namespace
- Deploy PGO to one namespaces, and all PostgreSQL clusters to a different
namespace
- Deploy PGO to one namespace, and have your PostgreSQL clusters managed across
multiple namespaces
- Dynamically add and remove namespaces managed by the PostgreSQL Operator using
the `pgo` client to run `pgo create namespace` and `pgo delete namespace`

#### Full Customizability

The Postgres Operator (PGO) makes it easy to get Postgres up and running on
Kubernetes-enabled platforms, but we know that there are further customizations
that you can make. As such, PGO allows you to further customize your
deployments, including:

- Selecting different storage classes for your primary, replica, and backup storage
- Select your own container resources class for each PostgreSQL cluster deployment; differentiate between resources applied for primary and replica clusters!
- Use your own container image repository, including support `imagePullSecrets` and private repositories
- [Customize your PostgreSQL configuration](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/advanced/custom-configuration/)
- Bring your own trusted certificate authority (CA) for use with the Operator API server
- Override your PostgreSQL configuration for each cluster

## Deployment Requirements

PGO, the Postgres Operator, is validated for deployment on Kubernetes,
OpenShift, GKE, Anthos, AKS, EKS, and VMware Tanzu clusters. PGO is cloud native
and storage agnostic, working with a wide variety of storage classes, hostPath,
and NFS.

PGO includes various components that get deployed to your Kubernetes cluster as
shown in the following diagram and detailed in the Design section of the
documentation for the version you are running.

![Reference](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/latest/Operator-Architecture.png)

PGO is developed and tested on CentOS and RHEL linux platforms but is known to
run on other Linux variants.

### Supported Platforms

PGO, the Postgres Operator, is Kubernetes-native and maintains backwards
compatibility to Kubernetes 1.11 and is tested is tested against the following
platforms:

- Kubernetes 1.17+
- Openshift 4.4+
- OpenShift 3.11
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), including Anthos
- Amazon EKS
- Microsoft AKS
- VMware Tanzu

This list only includes the platforms that the Postgres Operator is specifically
tested on as part of the release process: PGO works on other Kubernetes
distributions as well.

### Storage

PGO, the Postgres Operator, is tested with a variety of different types of
Kubernetes storage and Storage Classes, as well as hostPath and NFS.

We know there are a variety of different types of [Storage Classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/)
available for Kubernetes and we do our best to test each one, but due to the
breadth of this area we are unable to verify Postgres Operator functionality in
each one. With that said, the PostgreSQL Operator is designed to be storage
class agnostic and has been demonstrated to work with additional Storage
Classes.

## Installation

### Postgres Operator (PGO) Installation

PGO provides a few different methods for installation methods to get up and
running with cloud native Postgres.

Based on your storage settings in your Kubernetes environment, you may be able
to start as quickly as:
