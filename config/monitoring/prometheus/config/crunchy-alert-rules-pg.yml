########## PGBACKREST RULES ##########
#
# Uncomment and customize one or more of these rules to monitor your pgbackrest backups.
# Full backups are considered the equivalent of both differentials and incrementals since both are based on the last full
#   And differentials are considered incrementals since incrementals will be based off the last diff if one exists
#   This avoid false alerts, for example when you don't run diff/incr backups on the days that you run a full
# Stanza should also be set if different intervals are expected for each stanza.
#   Otherwise rule will be applied to all stanzas returned on target system if not set.
#
# Relevant metric names are:
#   ccp_backrest_last_full_backup_time_since_completion_seconds
#   ccp_backrest_last_incr_backup_time_since_completion_seconds
#   ccp_backrest_last_diff_backup_time_since_completion_seconds
#
# To avoid false positives on backup time alerts, 12 hours are added onto each threshold to allow a buffer if the backup runtime varies from day to day.
#    Further adjustment may be needed depending on your backup runtimes/schedule.
#

#
#
# Runtime monitoring is handled with a single metric:
#
#   ccp_backrest_last_info_backup_runtime_seconds
#
# Runtime monitoring should have the "backup_type" label set.
#   Otherwise the rule will apply to the last run of all backup types returned (full, diff, incr)
# Stanza should also be set if runtimes per stanza have different expected times

#
## If the pgbackrest command fails to run, the metric disappears from the exporter output and the alert never fires.
## An absence alert must be configured explicitly for each target (job) that backups are being monitored.
## Checking for absence of just the full backup type should be sufficient (no need for diff/incr).
## Note that while the backrest check command failing will likely also cause a scrape error alert, the addition of this
## check gives a clearer answer as to what is causing it and that something is wrong with the backups.
