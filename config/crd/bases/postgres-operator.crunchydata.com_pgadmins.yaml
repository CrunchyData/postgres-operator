                            of ClusterTrustBundle objects in an auto-updating file.

                            Alpha, gated by the ClusterTrustBundleProjection feature gate.

                            ClusterTrustBundle objects can either be selected by name, or by the
                            combination of signer name and a label selector.

                            Kubelet performs aggressive normalization of the PEM contents written
                            into the pod filesystem.  Esoteric PEM features such as inter-block
                            comments and block headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated.
                            The ordering of certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet
                            may change the order over time.

                      volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                      core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                      When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                      the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                      provisioner.
                      This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                      if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                      When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                        specified.
                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                        in any namespaces.

                                Kubelet performs aggressive normalization of the PEM contents written
                                into the pod filesystem.  Esoteric PEM features such as inter-block
                                comments and block headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated.
                                The ordering of certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet
                                may change the order over time.
