                                    zones, it will violate MaxSkew. \n This is an

                                        they must have the same value. For backwards
                                        compatibility, both fields (DataSource and
                                        DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value
                                        automatically if one of them is empty and
                                        the other is non-empty. There are two important
                                        differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef:
                                        * While DataSource only allows two specific
                                        types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any
                                        non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                        objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                        values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves
                                        all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                        value is specified. (Beta) Using this field
                                        requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate
                                        to be enabled.'

                                      field and as such if both fields are non-empty,
                                      they must have the same value. For backwards
                                      compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef)
                                      will be set to the same value automatically
                                      if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                      There are two important differences between
                                      DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource
                                      only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                      objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                      values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves
                                      all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                      value is specified. (Beta) Using this field
                                      requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate
                                      to be enabled.'

                                Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose
                                nodes match the node selector. e.g. If TopologyKey
                                is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain
                                of that topology. And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone",
                                each zone is a domain of that topology. It's a required
                                field.

                                with a pod if it doesn''t satisfy the spread constraint.
                                - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not
                                to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler
                                to schedule the pod in any location, but giving higher
                                precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                skew. A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for
                                an incoming pod if and only if every possible node
                                assignment for that pod would violate "MaxSkew" on
                                some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew
                                is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector
                                spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P
                                |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule,
                                incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3)
                                to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3)
                                satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster
                                can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won''t make
                                it *more* imbalanced. It''s a required field.'
