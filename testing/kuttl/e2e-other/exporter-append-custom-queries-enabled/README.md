# Exporter - AppendCustomQueries Enabled

**Note**: This series of tests depends on PGO being deployed with the `AppendCustomQueries` feature gate ON. There is a separate set of tests in `e2e` that tests exporter functionality without the `AppendCustomQueries` feature.

When running this test, make sure that the `PGO_FEATURE_GATES` environment variable is set to "AppendCustomQueries=true" on the PGO Deployment.
