    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Kubernetes automatically adds environment variables describing every Service in a Pod's namespace.
      This can inadvertently change the behavior of things that read from the environment. For example,
      a PodSpec that worked in the past might start to fail when the Pod is recreated with new Services
      around.

spec:
  validationFailureAction: audit
  background: true
  rules:
  - name: validate-enableServiceLinks
    match:
      resources:
        kinds:
        - Pod
    validate:
      message: Do not inject Service environment variables.
      pattern:
        spec:
          enableServiceLinks: false
