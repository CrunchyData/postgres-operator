# pgpool Client Authentication Configuration File a custom version
# ===============================================
#
# The format rule in this file follows the rules in the PostgreSQL
# Administrator's Guide. Refer to chapter "Client Authentication" for a
# complete description.  A short synopsis follows.
#
# This file controls: which hosts are allowed to connect, how clients
# are authenticated, which user names they can use, which databases they
# can access.  Records take one of these forms:
#
# local      DATABASE  USER  METHOD  [OPTION]
# host       DATABASE  USER  CIDR-ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTION]
#
# (The uppercase items must be replaced by actual values.)
#
# The first field is the connection type: "local" is a Unix-domain
# socket, "host" is either a plain or SSL-encrypted TCP/IP socket.
#
# DATABASE can be "all", "sameuser", a database name, or a comma-separated
# list thereof. Note that "samegroup" like in PostgreSQL's pg_hba.conf
# file is not supported, since pgpool does not know which group a user
# belongs to. Also note that the database specified here may not exist in
# the backend PostgreSQL. pgpool will authenticate based on the database's
# name, not based on whether it exists or not.
#
# USER can be "all", a user name, or a comma-separated list thereof.  In
# both the DATABASE and USER fields you can also write a file name prefixed
# with "@" to include names from a separate file. Note that a group name
# prefixed with "+" like in PostgreSQL's pg_hba.conf file is not supported
# because of the same reason as "samegroup" token. Also note that a user
# name specified here may not exist in the backend PostgreSQL. pgpool will
# authenticate based on the user's name, not based on whether he/she exists.
#
# CIDR-ADDRESS specifies the set of hosts the record matches.
# It is made up of an IP address and a CIDR mask that is an integer
# (between 0 and 32 (IPv4) that specifies the number of significant bits in
# the mask.  Alternatively, you can write an IP address and netmask in
# separate columns to specify the set of hosts.
#
# METHOD can be "trust", "reject", "md5" or "pam".  Note that "pam" sends passwords
# in clear text.
#
# OPTION is the name of the PAM service. Default service name is "pgpool"
#
# Database and user names containing spaces, commas, quotes and other special
# characters must be quoted. Quoting one of the keywords "all" or "sameuser"
# makes the name lose its special character, and just match a database or
# username with that name.
#
# This file is read on pgpool startup.  If you edit the file on a running
# system, you have to restart the pgpool  for the changes to take effect.

# Put your actual configuration here
# ----------------------------------
#
# If you want to allow non-local connections, you need to add more
# "host" records. In that case you will also need to make pgpool listen
# on a non-local interface via the listen_addresses configuration parameter.
#

# TYPE  DATABASE    USER        CIDR-ADDRESS          METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
#local   all         all                               trust
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all         all         0.0.0.0/0          md5
