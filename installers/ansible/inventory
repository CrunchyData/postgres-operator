# ==================
# Installation Methods
# One of the following blocks must be updated:
# - Deploy into Kubernetes
# - Deploy into Openshift

# Deploy into Openshift
# ==================
# Note: openshift_host can use the format https://URL:PORT
# Note: openshift_token can be used for token authentication
# ==================
# openshift_host=''
# openshift_skip_tls_verify=true
# openshift_user=''
# openshift_password=''
# openshift_token=''

# Deploy into Kubernetes
# ==================
# Note: Context name can be found using:
#   kubectl config current-context
# ==================
# kubernetes_context=''

# Create RBAC
# ==================
# Note: you may disable creating RBAC resources if they where already
# provisoned by a cluster admin.
# ==================
create_rbac='true'

# Namespace Mode
# ==================
# Note: this setting is only applicable if 'create_rbac=true'.
#
# When installing RBAC using 'create_rbac', the namespace mode determines
# what Cluster Roles are installed.  The default mode if a value is not
# specified here is "dynamic", which gives the Operator the full set of
# Cluster Roles to create/modify/delete namespaces, and also install RBAC
# within those namespaces in order to create PG clusters.  A value of
# "readonly" can also be specified, which allows the Operator to view
# namespaces, but not create/modify/delete them nor create  RBAC within
# them.  And finally "disabled" prevents the creation of any Cluster Roles,
# and therefore disables all namespace functionality.
# ==================
# namespace_mode='dynamic'

# Dynamic RBAC
# ==================
# Note: this setting is only applicable if 'namespace_mode' is set to
# 'readonly' or 'disabled'.
#
# When creating target namespaces during installation, this setting
# determines what RBAC is created within the target namespace.  If set to
# 'true', the RBAC created in those namespaces will allow the PostgreSQL
# Operator itself to create the ServiceAccounts, Roles and RoleBindings
# it requires to create PG clusters.  If set to 'false' (the default),
# the installer will instead create the ServiceAccounts, Roles and
# RoleBindings), and the PostgreSQL Operator will not be granted the
# ability to create the RBAC it requires within those namespaces.
# ==================
# dynamic_rbac='false'

# This will set the default pod anti-affinity for the deployed PostgreSQL
# clusters. Pod Anti-Affinity is set to determine where the PostgreSQL Pods are
# deployed relative to each other There are three levels:
#
# - required: Pods *must* be scheduled to different Nodes. If a Pod cannot be
#   scheduled to a different Node from the other Pods in the anti-affinity
#   group, then it will not be scheduled.
# - preferred (default): Pods *should* be scheduled to different Nodes. There is
#   a chance that two Pods in the same anti-affinity group could be scheduled to
#   the same node
# - disabled: Pods do not have any anti-affinity rules
#
# The `pod_anti_affinity` label sets the Pod anti-affinity for all of the Pods
# that are managed by the Operator in a PostgreSQL cluster. In addition to the
# PostgreSQL Pods, this also includes the pgBackRest repository and any
# pgBouncer pods. By default, the pgBackRest and pgBouncer pods inherit the
# value of `pod_anti_affinity`, but one can override the default by setting

# for pgBackRest and pgBouncer respectively
