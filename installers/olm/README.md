This directory contains the files that are used to install [Crunchy PostgreSQL for Kubernetes][hub-listing],
which uses the PostgreSQL Operator, using [Operator Lifecycle Manager][OLM].

The integration centers around a [ClusterServiceVersion][olm-csv] [manifest](./postgresoperator.csv.yaml)
that gets packaged for OperatorHub. Changes there are accepted only if they pass all the [scorecard][]
tests. Consult the [technical requirements][hub-contrib] when making changes.
