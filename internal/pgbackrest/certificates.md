Server
------

pgBackRest uses OpenSSL to protect connections between machines. The [TLS server](tls-server.md)
listens on a TCP port, encrypts connections with its server certificate, and
verifies client certificates against a certificate authority.

- `tls-server-ca-file` is used for client verification. It is the path to a file
  of trusted certificates concatenated in PEM format. When this is set, clients
  are also authorized according to `tls-server-auth`.

  See https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations.html

- `tls-server-cert-file` is the server certificate. It is the path to a file in
  PEM format containing the certificate as well as any number of CA certificates
  needed to establish its authenticity.

  See https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file.html

- `tls-server-key-file` is the server certificate's private key. It is the path
  to a file in PEM format.

  See https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file.html


Clients
-------

pgBackRest uses OpenSSL to protect connections it makes to PostgreSQL instances
and repository hosts. It presents a client certificate that is verified by the
server and must contain a common name (CN) that is authorized according to `tls-server-auth`.

- `pg-host-ca-file` is used for server verification when connecting to
  pgBackRest on a PostgreSQL instance. It is the path to a file of trusted
  certificates concatenated in PEM format.

  See https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations.html

- `pg-host-cert-file` is the client certificate to present when connecting to
  pgBackRest on a PostgreSQL instance. It is the path to a file in PEM format
  containing the certificate as well as any number of CA certificates needed to
  establish its authenticity.

  See https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file.html

- `pg-host-key-file` is the client certificate's private key. It is the path
  to a file in PEM format.

  See https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file.html

- `repo-host-ca-file` is used for server verification when connecting to
  pgBackRest on a repository host. It is the path to a file of trusted
  certificates concatenated in PEM format.

  See https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations.html

- `repo-host-cert-file` is the client certificate to present when connecting to
  pgBackRest on a repository host. It is the path to a file in PEM format
  containing the certificate as well as any number of CA certificates needed to
  establish its authenticity.

  See https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man3/SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file.html

- `repo-host-key-file` is the client certificate's private key. It is the path
  to a file in PEM format.
