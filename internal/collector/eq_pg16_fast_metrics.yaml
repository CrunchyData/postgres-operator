# NOTE: Some of the columns below can return NULL values, for which sqlqueryreceiver will warn.

# Those columns are retained_bytes, database, and conflicting and we avoid NULL by using COALESCE.

On a hot standby, the slots with the synced column marked as true can neither be used for logical decoding nor dropped manually. The value of this column has no meaning on the primary server; the column value on the primary is default false for all slots but may (if leftover from a promoted standby) also be true.
