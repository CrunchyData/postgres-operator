// Switchover performs a controlled switchover within a PostgreSQL cluster, i.e.
// demoting a primary and promoting a replica. There are two types of switchover
// methods that can be invoked.
//
// Method #1: Automatic Choice
//
// The switchover command invokves Patroni which works as such:
//
// 1. The function looks for all available replicas as well as the current
// primary. We look up the primary for convenience to avoid various API calls
//
// 2. We then search over the list to find both a primary and a suitable
// candidate for promotion. A candidate is suitable if:
//
//   - It is on the latest timeline
//   - It has the least amount of replication lag
//
// This is done to limit the risk of data loss.
//
// If either a primary or candidate is **not** found, we do not switch over.
//
// 3. If all of the above works successfully, a switchover is attempted.
//
// Method #2: Targeted Choice
//
// 1. If the "target" parameter, which should contain the name of the target
// instances (Deployment), is not empty then we will attempt to locate that
// target Pod.
//
// 2. The target Pod name, called the candidate is passed into the switchover
// command generation function, and then is ultimately used in the switchover.

	// If target is specified, then we will attempt to get the Pod that
	// represents that target.

	// If it is not specified, then we will attempt to get any Pod.
