/* Package routing temporarily breaks circular dependencies within the
structure of the apiserver package

The apiserver package contains a mix of package content (used by external
code) and refactored functionality from the *service folders. The
refactored functionality of the *service folders causes import dependencies
on the apiserver package.

Strictly speaking, the *service folders are an organizational element and
their dependencies could be resolved via dot-import. Idiomatic Go
guidelines point out that using a dot-import outside of testing scenarios is
a sign that package structure needs to be reconsidered and should not be
used outside of the *_test.go scenarios.

Creating this package is preferable to pushing all service-common code into
a 'junk-drawer' package to resolve the circular dependency.
