## Manually Restarting PostgreSQL

There are times when you might need to manually restart PostgreSQL. This can be done by adding or updating a custom annotation to the cluster's `spec.metadata.annotations` section. PGO will notice the change and perform a [rolling restart]({{< relref "/architecture/high-availability.md" >}}#rolling-update).

For example, if you have a cluster named `hippo` in the namespace `postgres-operator`, all you need to do is patch the hippo postgrescluster with the following:

```
kubectl patch postgrescluster/hippo --type=merge --patch='{"spec":{"metadata":{"annotations":{"restart":"'"$(date)"'"}}}}' -n postgres-operator
```

Watch your hippo cluster: you will see the rolling update has been triggered and the restart has begun.

## Next Steps

We've covered a lot in terms of building, maintaining, scaling, customizing, restarting, and expanding our Postgres cluster. However, there may come a time where we need to [delete our Postgres cluster]({{< relref "delete-cluster.md" >}}). How do we do that?
