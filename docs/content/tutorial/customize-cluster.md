Postgres is known for its ease of customization; PGO helps you to roll out changes efficiently and without disruption. After [resizing the resources]({{< relref "./resize-cluster.md" >}}) for our Postgres cluster in the previous step of this tutorial, lets see how we can tweak our Postgres configuration to optimize its usage of them.

## Custom Postgres Configuration

Part of the trick of managing multiple instances in a Postgres cluster is ensuring all of the configuration
changes are propagated to each of them. This is where PGO helps: when you make a Postgres configuration
change for a cluster, PGO will apply it to all of the Postgres instances.

For example, in our previous step we added CPU and memory limits of `2.0` and `4Gi` respectively. Let's tweak some of the Postgres settings to better use our new resources. We can do this in the `spec.patroni.dynamicConfiguration` section. Here is an example updated manifest that tweaks several settings:

```
apiVersion: postgres-operator.crunchydata.com/v1beta1
kind: PostgresCluster
metadata:
  name: hippo
spec:
  image: {{< param imageCrunchyPostgres >}}
  postgresVersion: {{< param postgresVersion >}}
  instances:
    - name: instance1
      replicas: 2
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: 2.0
          memory: 4Gi
      dataVolumeClaimSpec:
        accessModes:
        - "ReadWriteOnce"
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi
  backups:
    pgbackrest:
      image: {{< param imageCrunchyPGBackrest >}}
      repos:
      - name: repo1
        volume:
          volumeClaimSpec:
            accessModes:
            - "ReadWriteOnce"
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 1Gi
  patroni:
    dynamicConfiguration:
      postgresql:
        parameters:
          max_parallel_workers: 2
          max_worker_processes: 2
          shared_buffers: 1GB
          work_mem: 2MB
```

In particular, we added the following to `spec`:

```
patroni:
  dynamicConfiguration:
    postgresql:
      parameters:
        max_parallel_workers: 2
        max_worker_processes: 2
        shared_buffers: 1GB
        work_mem: 2MB
```

Apply these updates to your Postgres cluster with the following command:

```
kubectl apply -k kustomize/postgres
```

PGO will go and apply these settings, restarting each Postgres instance when necessary. You can verify that the changes are present using the Postgres `SHOW` command, e.g.

```
SHOW work_mem;
```

should yield something similar to:

```
 work_mem
----------
 2MB
```

## Customize TLS

All connections in PGO use TLS to encrypt communication between components. PGO sets up a PKI and certificate authority (CA) that allow you create verifiable endpoints. However, you may want to bring a different TLS infrastructure based upon your organizational requirements. The good news: PGO lets you do this!

If you want to use the TLS infrastructure that PGO provides, you can skip the rest of this section and move on to learning how to [apply software updates]({{< relref "./update-cluster.md" >}}).

### How to Customize TLS

There are a few different TLS endpoints that can be customized for PGO, including those of the Postgres cluster and controlling how Postgres instances authenticate with each other. Let's look at how we can customize TLS.

Your TLS certificate should have a Common Name (CN) setting that matches the primary Service name. This is the name of the cluster suffixed with `-primary`. For example, for our `hippo` cluster this would be `hippo-primary`.

To customize the TLS for a Postgres cluster, you will need to create a Secret in the Namespace of your Postgres cluster that contains the TLS key (`tls.key`), TLS certificate (`tls.crt`) and the CA certificate (`ca.crt`) to use. The Secret should contain the following values:

```
data:
  ca.crt: <value>
  tls.crt: <value>
  tls.key: <value>
```

For example, if you have files named `ca.crt`, `hippo.key`, and `hippo.crt` stored on your local machine, you could run the following command:

```
kubectl create secret generic -n postgres-operator hippo.tls \
  --from-file=ca.crt=ca.crt \
  --from-file=tls.key=hippo.key \
  --from-file=tls.crt=hippo.crt
```

You can specify the custom TLS Secret in the `spec.customTLSSecret.name` field in your `postgrescluster.postgres-operator.crunchydata.com` custom resource, e.g.:

```
spec:
  customTLSSecret:
    name: hippo.tls
```

If you're unable to control the key-value pairs in the Secret, you can create a mapping that looks similar to this:

```
spec:
  customTLSSecret:
    name: hippo.tls
    items:
      - key: <tls.crt key>
        path: tls.crt
      - key: <tls.key key>
        path: tls.key
      - key: <ca.crt key>
        path: ca.crt
```

If `spec.customTLSSecret` is provided you **must** also provide `spec.customReplicationTLSSecret` and both must contain the same `ca.crt`.

As with the other changes, you can roll out the TLS customizations with `kubectl apply`.

## Labels

There are several ways to add your own custom Kubernetes [Labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) to your Postgres cluster.

- Cluster: You can apply labels to any PGO managed object in a cluster by editing the `spec.metadata.labels` section of the custom resource.
- Postgres: You can apply labels to a Postgres instance set and its objects by editing `spec.instances.metadata.labels`.
- pgBackRest: You can apply labels to pgBackRest and its objects by editing `postgresclusters.spec.backups.pgbackrest.metadata.labels`.
- PgBouncer: You can apply labels to PgBouncer connection pooling instances by editing `spec.proxy.pgBouncer.metadata.labels`.

## Annotations

There are several ways to add your own custom Kubernetes [Annotations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/) to your Postgres cluster.

- Cluster: You can apply annotations to any PGO managed object in a cluster by editing the `spec.metadata.annotations` section of the custom resource.
- Postgres: You can apply annotations to a Postgres instance set and its objects by editing `spec.instances.metadata.annotations`.
- pgBackRest: You can apply annotations to pgBackRest and its objects by editing `spec.backups.pgbackrest.metadata.annotations`.
- PgBouncer: You can apply annotations to PgBouncer connection pooling instances by editing `spec.proxy.pgBouncer.metadata.annotations`.

## Pod Priority Classes

PGO allows you to use [pod priority classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/) to indicate the relative importance of a pod by setting a `priorityClassName` field on your Postgres cluster. This can be done as follows:

- Instances: Priority is defined per instance set and is applied to all Pods in that instance set by editing the `spec.instances.priorityClassName` section of the custom resource.
- Dedicated Repo Host: Priority defined under the repoHost section of the spec is applied to the dedicated repo host by editing the `spec.backups.pgbackrest.repoHost.priorityClassName` section of the custom resource.
- PgBouncer: Priority is defined under the pgBouncer section of the spec and will apply to all PgBouncer Pods by editing the `spec.proxy.pgBouncer.priorityClassName` section of the custom resource.
- Backup (manual and scheduled): Priority is defined under the `spec.backups.pgbackrest.jobs.priorityClassName` section and applies that priority to all pgBackRest backup Jobs (manual and scheduled).
- Restore (data source or in-place): Priority is defined for either a "data source" restore or an in-place restore by editing the `spec.dataSource.postgresCluster.priorityClassName` section of the custom resource.
- Data Migration: The priority defined for the first instance set in the spec (array position 0) is used for the PGDATA and WAL migration Jobs. The pgBackRest repo migration Job will use the priority class applied to the repoHost.

## Separate WAL PVCs

PostgreSQL commits transactions by storing changes in its [Write-Ahead Log (WAL)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html). Because the way WAL files are accessed and
utilized often differs from that of data files, and in high-performance situations, it can desirable to put WAL files on separate storage volume. With PGO, this can be done by adding
the `walVolumeClaimSpec` block to your desired instance in your PostgresCluster spec, either when your cluster is created or anytime thereafter:

```
spec:
  instances:
    - name: instance
      walVolumeClaimSpec:
        accessModes:
        - "ReadWriteMany"
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi
```

This volume can be removed later by removing the `walVolumeClaimSpec` section from the instance. Note that when changing the WAL directory, care is taken so as not to lose any WAL files. PGO only
deletes the PVC once there are no longer any WAL files on the previously configured volume.

## Custom Sidecar Containers

PGO allows you to configure custom
[sidecar Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#how-pods-manage-multiple-containers)
for your PostgreSQL instance and pgBouncer Pods.

To use the custom sidecar features, currently in `Alpha`, you will need to enable
them via the PGO
[feature gate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/).

PGO feature gates are enabled by setting the `PGO_FEATURE_GATES` environment
variable on the PGO Deployment. For a feature named 'FeatureName', that would
look like

```
PGO_FEATURE_GATES="FeatureName=true"
```

Please note that it is possible to enable more than one feature at a time as
this variable accepts a comma delimited list, for example:

```
PGO_FEATURE_GATES="FeatureName=true,FeatureName2=true,FeatureName3=true..."
```

{{% notice warning %}}
Any feature name added to `PGO_FEATURE_GATES` must be defined by PGO and must be
set to true or false. Any misconfiguration will prevent PGO from deploying.
See the [considerations](#considerations) below for additional guidance.
{{% /notice %}}

### Custom Sidecar Containers for PostgreSQL Instance Pods

To configure custom sidecar Containers for any of your PostgreSQL instance Pods
you will need to enable that feature via the PGO feature gate.

As mentioned above, PGO feature gates are enabled by setting the `PGO_FEATURE_GATES`
environment variable on the PGO Deployment. For the PostgreSQL instance sidecar
container feature, that will be

```
PGO_FEATURE_GATES="InstanceSidecars=true"
```

Once this feature is enabled, you can add your custom
[Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.20/#container-v1-core)
as an array to `spec.instances.containers`. See the [custom sidecar example](#custom-sidecar-example)
below for more information!

### Custom Sidecar Containers for pgBouncer Pods

Similar to your PostgreSQL instance Pods, to configure custom sidecar Containers
for your pgBouncer Pods you will need to enable it via the PGO feature gate.

As mentioned above, PGO feature gates are enabled by setting the `PGO_FEATURE_GATES`
environment variable on the PGO Deployment. For the pgBouncer custom sidecar
container feature, that will be

```
PGO_FEATURE_GATES="PGBouncerSidecars=true"
```

Once this feature is enabled, you can add your custom
[Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.20/#container-v1-core)
as an array to `spec.proxy.pgBouncer.containers`. See the [custom sidecar example](#custom-sidecar-example)
below for more information!

### Custom Sidecar Example

As a simple example, consider

```
apiVersion: postgres-operator.crunchydata.com/v1beta1
kind: PostgresCluster
metadata:
  name: sidecar-hippo
spec:
  image: {{< param imageCrunchyPostgres >}}
  postgresVersion: {{< param postgresVersion >}}
  instances:
    - name: instance1
      containers:
      - name: testcontainer
        image: mycontainer1:latest
      - name: testcontainer2
        image: mycontainer1:latest
      dataVolumeClaimSpec:
        accessModes:
        - "ReadWriteOnce"
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi
  backups:
    pgbackrest:
      image: {{< param imageCrunchyPGBackrest >}}
      repos:
      - name: repo1
        volume:
          volumeClaimSpec:
            accessModes:
            - "ReadWriteOnce"
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 1Gi
  proxy:
    pgBouncer:
      image: {{< param imageCrunchyPGBouncer >}}
      containers:
      - name: bouncertestcontainer1
        image: mycontainer1:latest
```

In the above example, we've added two sidecar Containers to the `instance1` Pod
and one sidecar container to the `pgBouncer` Pod. These Containers can be
defined in the manifest at any time, but the Containers will not be added to their
respective Pods until the feature gate is enabled.

### Considerations

- Volume mounts and other Pod details are subject to change between releases.
- The custom sidecar features are currently in `Alpha`. Any sidecar Containers,
  as well as any settings included in their configuration, are added and used at
  your own risk. Improperly configured sidecar Containers could impact the health
  and/or security of your PostgreSQL cluster!
- When adding a sidecar container, we recommend adding a unique prefix to the
  container name to avoid potential naming conflicts with the official PGO
  containers.

## Database Initialization SQL

PGO can run SQL for you as part of the cluster creation and initialization process. PGO runs the SQL using the psql client so you can use meta-commands to connect to different databases, change error handling, or set and use variables. Its capabilities are described in the [psql documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html).

### Initialization SQL ConfigMap

The Postgres cluster spec accepts a reference to a ConfigMap containing your init SQL file. Update your cluster spec to include the ConfigMap name, `spec.databaseInitSQL.name`, and the data key, `spec.databaseInitSQL.key`, for your SQL file. For example, if you create your ConfigMap with the following command:

```
kubectl -n postgres-operator create configmap hippo-init-sql --from-file=init.sql=/path/to/init.sql
```

You would add the following section to your Postgrescluster spec:

```
spec:
  databaseInitSQL:
    key: init.sql
    name: hippo-init-sql
```

{{% notice note %}}
The ConfigMap must exist in the same namespace as your Postgres cluster.
{{% /notice %}}

After you add the ConfigMap reference to your spec, apply the change with `kubectl apply -k kustomize/postgres`. PGO will create your `hippo` cluster and run your initialization SQL once the cluster has started. You can verify that your SQL has been run by checking the `databaseInitSQL` status on your Postgres cluster. While the status is set, your init SQL will not be run again. You can check cluster status with the `kubectl describe` command:

```
kubectl -n postgres-operator describe postgresclusters.postgres-operator.crunchydata.com hippo
```

{{% notice warning %}}

In some cases, due to how Kubernetes treats PostgresCluster status, PGO may run your SQL commands more than once. Please ensure that the commands defined in your init SQL are idempotent.

{{% /notice %}}

Now that `databaseInitSQL` is defined in your cluster status, verify database objects have been created as expected. After verifying, we recommend removing the `spec.databaseInitSQL` field from your spec. Removing the field from the spec will also remove `databaseInitSQL` from the cluster status.

### PSQL Usage
PGO uses the psql interactive terminal to execute SQL statements in your database. Statements are passed in using standard input and the filename flag (e.g. `psql -f -`).

SQL statements are executed as superuser in the default maintenance database. This means you have full control to create database objects, extensions, or run any SQL statements that you might need.

#### Integration with User and Database Management

If you are creating users or databases, please see the [User/Database Management]({{< relref "tutorial/user-management.md" >}}) documentation. Databases created through the user management section of the spec can be referenced in your initialization sql. For example, if a database `zoo` is defined:

```
spec:
  users:
    - name: hippo
      databases:
       - "zoo"
```

You can connect to `zoo` by adding the following `psql` meta-command to your SQL:

```
\c zoo
create table t_zoo as select s, md5(random()::text) from generate_Series(1,5) s;
```

#### Transaction support

By default, `psql` commits each SQL command as it completes. To combine multiple commands into a single [transaction](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-transactions.html), use the [`BEGIN`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-begin.html) and [`COMMIT`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-commit.html) commands.

```
BEGIN;
create table t_random as select s, md5(random()::text) from generate_Series(1,5) s;
COMMIT;
```

#### PSQL Exit Code and Database Init SQL Status

The exit code from `psql` will determine when the `databaseInitSQL` status is set. When `psql` returns `0` the status will be set and SQL will not be run again. When `psql` returns with an error exit code the status will not be set. PGO will continue attempting to execute the SQL as part of its reconcile loop until `psql` returns normally. If `psql` exits with a failure, you will need to edit the file in your ConfigMap to ensure your SQL statements will lead to a successful `psql` return. The easiest way to make live changes to your ConfigMap is to use the following `kubectl edit` command:

```
kubectl -n <cluster-namespace> edit configmap hippo-init-sql
```

Be sure to transfer any changes back over to your local file. Another option is to make changes in your local file and use `kubectl --dry-run` to create a template and pipe the output into `kubectl apply`:

```
kubectl create configmap hippo-init-sql --from-file=init.sql=/path/to/init.sql --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

{{% notice tip %}}
If you edit your ConfigMap and your changes aren't showing up, you may be waiting for PGO to reconcile your cluster. After some time, PGO will automatically reconcile the cluster or you can trigger reconciliation by applying any change to your cluster (e.g. with `kubectl apply -k kustomize/postgres`).
{{% /notice %}}

To ensure that `psql` returns a failure exit code when your SQL commands fail, set the `ON_ERROR_STOP` [variable](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html#APP-PSQL-VARIABLES) as part of your SQL file:

```
\set ON_ERROR_STOP
\echo Any error will lead to exit code 3
create table t_random as select s, md5(random()::text) from generate_Series(1,5) s;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Changes Not Applied

If your Postgres configuration settings are not present, ensure that you are using the syntax that Postgres expects.
You can see this in the [Postgres configuration documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config.html).

## Next Steps

You've now seen how you can further customize your Postgres cluster, but what about [managing users and databases]({{< relref "./user-management.md" >}})? That's a great question that is answered in the [next section]({{< relref "./user-management.md" >}}).
