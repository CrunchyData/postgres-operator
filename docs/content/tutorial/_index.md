The PostgreSQL Operator provides functionality that lets you run your own database-as-a-service: from deploying PostgreSQL clusters with [high availability]({{< relref "architecture/high-availability/_index.md" >}}), to a [full stack monitoring]({{< relref "architecture/high-availability/_index.md" >}}) solution, essential [disaster recovery and backup tools]({{< relref "architecture/disaster-recovery.md" >}}), the ability to secure your cluster with TLS, and much more!

What's more, you can manage your PostgreSQL clusters with the convenient [`pgo` client]({{< relref "pgo-client/_index.md" >}}) or by interfacing directly with the PostgreSQL Operator [custom resources]({{< relref "custom-resources/_index.md" >}}).

Given the robustness of the PostgreSQL Operator, we think it's helpful to break down the functionality in this step-by-step tutorial. The tutorial covers the essential functions the PostgreSQL Operator can perform and covers many common basic and advanced use cases.

So what are you waiting for? Let's [get started]({{< relref "tutorial/getting-started.md" >}})!
