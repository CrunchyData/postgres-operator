# Installing PGO Using Kustomize

This section provides instructions for installing and configuring PGO using Kustomize.

## Prerequisites

First, go to GitHub and [fork the Postgres Operator examples](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator-examples/fork)
repository, which contains the PGO Kustomize installer.

[https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator-examples/fork](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator-examples/fork)

Once you have forked this repo, you can download it to your working environment with a command 
similar to this:

```
YOUR_GITHUB_UN="<your GitHub username>"
git clone --depth 1 "git@github.com:${YOUR_GITHUB_UN}/postgres-operator-examples.git"
cd postgres-operator-examples
```

The PGO installation project is located in the `kustomize/install` directory.

## Configuration

While the default Kustomize install should work in most Kubernetes environments, it may be 
necessary to further customize the Kustomize project(s) according to your specific needs.

For instance, to customize the image tags utilized for the PGO Deployment, the `images` setting
in the `kustomize/install/bases/kustomization.yaml` file can be modified:

```yaml
images:
- name: postgres-operator
  newName: registry.developers.crunchydata.com/crunchydata
  newTag: ubi8-5.0.1-0
```

Additionally, please note that the Kustomize install project will also create a namespace for PGO
by default (though it is possible to install without creating the namespace, as shown below).  To
modify the name of namespace created by the installer, the `kustomize/install/namespace.yaml`
should be modified:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: custom-namespace
```

Additionally, the `namespace` setting in  `kustomize/install/bases/kustomization.yaml` should be
modified accordingly.

```yaml
namespace: custom-namespace
```

Additional Kustomize overlays can then also be created to further patch and customize the
installation according to your specific needs.

### Installation Mode

When PGO is installed, it can be configured to manage PostgreSQL clusters in all namespaces within
the Kubernetes cluster, or just those within a single namespace.  When managing PostgreSQL
clusters in all namespaces, a ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding is created to ensure PGO has
the permissions it requires to properly manage PostgreSQL clusters across all namespaces.  However,
when PGO is configured to manage PostgreSQL clusters within a single namespace only, a Role and 
RoleBinding is created instead.

By default, the Kustomize installer will configure PGO to manage PostgreSQL clusters in all
namespaces, which means a ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding will also be created by default.
To instead configure PGO to manage PostgreSQL clusters in only a single namespace, simply modify 
the `bases` section of the `kustomize/install/bases/kustomization.yaml` file as follows:

```yaml
bases:
- crd
- rbac/namespace
- manager
```

Note that `rbac/cluster` has been changed to `rbac/namespace`.  

As well as the PGO_TARGET_NAMESPACE environment variable located in the env section of the `kustomize/install/bases/manager/manager.yaml` file as follows:

```yaml
        env:
        - name: PGO_TARGET_NAMESPACE
          valueFrom: { fieldRef: { apiVersion: v1, fieldPath: metadata.namespace } }
```

With these configuration changes, PGO will create a Role and RoleBinding, and will therefore only manage PostgreSQL clusters created within the namespace defined using the `namespace` setting in the
`kustomize/install/bases/kustomization.yaml` file:

```yaml
namespace: postgres-operator
```

## Install

Once the Kustomize project has been modified according to your specific needs, PGO can then
be installed using `kubectl` and Kustomize.  To create both the target namespace for PGO and
then install PGO itself, the following command can be utilized:

```shell
kubectl apply -k kustomize/install
```

However, if the namespace has already been created, the following command can be utilized to
install PGO only:

```shell
kubectl apply -k kustomize/install/bases
```

## Uninstall

Once PGO has been installed, it can also be uninstalled using `kubectl` and Kustomize.
To uninstall PGO and then also delete the namespace it had been deployed into (assuming the 
namespace was previously created using the Kustomize installer as described above), the 
following command can be utilized:

```shell
kubectl delete -k kustomize/install
```

To uninstall PGO only (e.g. if Kustomize was not initially utilized to create the PGO namespace),
the following command can be utilized:

```shell
kubectl delete -k kustomize/install/bases
```
