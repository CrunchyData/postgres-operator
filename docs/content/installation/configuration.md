# PostgreSQL Operator Installer Configuration

The [`pgo-deployer` container]({{< relref "/installation/postgres-operator" >}})
is launched by using a Kubernetes Job manifest and contains many configurable
options.

This section lists the options that you can configure to deploy the PostgreSQL
Operator in your environment. The following list of environmental variables can
be used in the [`postgres-operator.yml`](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator/blob/v4.3.4/installers/kubectl/postgres-operator.yml)

## Storage Settings

The store configuration options defined in this section can be used to specify
the storage configurations that are used by the PostgreSQL Operator.

## Storage Configuration Options

Kubernetes and OpenShift offer support for a wide variety of different storage
types and we provide suggested configurations for different environments. These
storage types can be modified or removed as needed, while additional storage
configurations can also be added to meet the specific storage requirements for
your PostgreSQL clusters.

The following storage variables are utilized to add or modify operator storage
configurations in the with the installer:

| Name | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `storage<ID>_name` | Yes | Set to specify a name for the storage configuration. |
| `storage<ID>_access_mode` | Yes | Set to configure the access mode of the volumes created when using this storage definition. |
| `storage<ID>_size` | Yes | Set to configure the size of the volumes created when using this storage definition. |
| `storage<ID>_class` | Required when using the `dynamic` storage type | Set to configure the storage class name used when creating dynamic volumes. |
| `storage<ID>_supplemental_groups` | Required when using NFS storage | Set to configure any supplemental groups that should be added to security contexts on newly created clusters. |
| `storage<ID>_type` | Yes  | Set to either `create` or `dynamic` to configure the operator to create persistent volumes or have them created dynamically by a storage class. |

The ID portion of storage prefix for each variable name above should be an
integer that is used to group the various storage variables into a single
storage configuration.

### Example Storage Configuration

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| STORAGE3_NAME | nfsstorage |
| STORAGE3_ACCESS_MODE | ReadWriteMany |
| STORAGE3_SIZE | 1G |
| STORAGE3_TYPE | create |
| STORAGE3_SUPPLEMENTAL_GROUPS | 65534 |

As this example storage configuration shows, integer `3` is used as the ID for
each of the `storage` variables, which together form a single storage
configuration called `nfsstorage`. This approach allows different storage
configurations to be created by defining the proper `storage` variables with a
unique ID for each required storage configuration.

### PostgreSQL Cluster Storage Defaults

You can specify the default storage to use for PostgreSQL, pgBackRest, and other
elements that require storage that can outlast the lifetime of a Pod. While the
PostgreSQL Operator defaults to using `hostpathstorage` to work with
environments that are typically used to test, we recommend using one of the
other storage classes in production deployments.

| Name | Default | Required | Description |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `BACKREST_STORAGE` | hostpathstorage | **Required** | Set the value of the storage configuration to use for the pgbackrest shared repository deployment created when a user specifies pgbackrest to be enabled on a cluster. |
| `BACKUP_STORAGE` | hostpathstorage | **Required** | Set the value of the storage configuration to use for backups, including the storage for pgbackrest repo volumes. |
| `PRIMARY_STORAGE` | hostpathstorage | **Required** | 	Set to configure which storage definition to use when creating volumes used by PostgreSQL primaries on all newly created clusters. |
| `REPLICA_STORAGE` | hostpathstorage | **Required** | Set to configure which storage definition to use when creating volumes used by PostgreSQL replicas on all newly created clusters. |
| `WAL_STORAGE` |  |  | Set to configure which storage definition to use when creating volumes used for PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Log |

## Pod Anti-affinity Settings
This will set the default pod anti-affinity for the deployed PostgreSQL
clusters. Pod Anti-Affinity is set to determine where the PostgreSQL Pods are
deployed relative to each other There are three levels:

- required: Pods *must* be scheduled to different Nodes. If a Pod cannot be
  scheduled to a different Node from the other Pods in the anti-affinity
  group, then it will not be scheduled.
- preferred (default): Pods *should* be scheduled to different Nodes. There is
  a chance that two Pods in the same anti-affinity group could be scheduled to
  the same node
- disabled: Pods do not have any anti-affinity rules

The `POD_ANTI_AFFINITY` label sets the Pod anti-affinity for all of the Pods
that are managed by the Operator in a PostgreSQL cluster. In addition to the
PostgreSQL Pods, this also includes the pgBackRest repository and any
pgBouncer pods. By default, the pgBackRest and pgBouncer pods inherit the
value of `POD_ANTI_AFFINITY`, but one can override the default by setting
the `POD_ANTI_AFFINITY_PGBACKREST` and `POD_ANTI_AFFINITY_PGBOUNCER` variables
for pgBackRest and pgBouncer respectively

| Name | Default | Required | Description |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `POD_ANTI_AFFINITY` | preferred |  | This will set the default pod anti-affinity for the deployed PostgreSQL clusters. |
| `POD_ANTI_AFFINITY_PGBACKREST` |  |  | This will set the default pod anti-affinity for the pgBackRest pods. |
| `POD_ANTI_AFFINITY_PGBOUNCER` |  |  | This will set the default pod anti-affinity for the pgBouncer pods. |
