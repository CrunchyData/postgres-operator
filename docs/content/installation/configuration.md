## Storage Settings

The store configuration options defined in this section can be used to specify
the storage configurations that are used by the PostgreSQL Operator.

## Storage Configuration Options

Kubernetes and OpenShift offer support for a wide variety of different storage
types and we provide suggested configurations for different environments. These
storage types can be modified or removed as needed, while additional storage
configurations can also be added to meet the specific storage requirements for
your PostgreSQL clusters.

The following storage variables are utilized to add or modify operator storage
configurations in the with the installer:

| Name | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `storage<ID>_name` | Yes | Set to specify a name for the storage configuration. |
| `storage<ID>_access_mode` | Yes | Set to configure the access mode of the volumes created when using this storage definition. |
| `storage<ID>_size` | Yes | Set to configure the size of the volumes created when using this storage definition. |
| `storage<ID>_class` | Required when using the `dynamic` storage type | Set to configure the storage class name used when creating dynamic volumes. |
| `storage<ID>_supplemental_groups` | Required when using NFS storage | Set to configure any supplemental groups that should be added to security contexts on newly created clusters. |
| `storage<ID>_type` | Yes  | Set to either `create` or `dynamic` to configure the operator to create persistent volumes or have them created dynamically by a storage class. |

The ID portion of storage prefix for each variable name above should be an
integer that is used to group the various storage variables into a single
storage configuration.

### Example Storage Configuration

```yaml
storage3_name: 'nfsstorage'
storage3_access_mode: 'ReadWriteMany'
storage3_size: '1G'
storage3_type: 'create'
storage3_supplemental_groups: 65534
```

As this example storage configuration shows, integer `3` is used as the ID for
each of the `storage` variables, which together form a single storage
configuration called `nfsstorage`. This approach allows different storage
configurations to be created by defining the proper `storage` variables with a
unique ID for each required storage configuration.

### PostgreSQL Cluster Storage Defaults

You can specify the default storage to use for PostgreSQL, pgBackRest, and other
elements that require storage that can outlast the lifetime of a Pod. While the
PostgreSQL Operator defaults to using `hostpathstorage` to work with
environments that are typically used to test, we recommend using one of the
other storage classes in production deployments.

| Name | Default | Required | Description |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `backrest_storage` | hostpathstorage | **Required** | Set the value of the storage configuration to use for the pgbackrest shared repository deployment created when a user specifies pgbackrest to be enabled on a cluster. |
| `backup_storage` | hostpathstorage | **Required** | Set the value of the storage configuration to use for backups, including the storage for pgbackrest repo volumes. |
| `primary_storage` | hostpathstorage | **Required** | Set to configure which storage definition to use when creating volumes used by PostgreSQL primaries on all newly created clusters. |
| `replica_storage` | hostpathstorage | **Required** | Set to configure which storage definition to use when creating volumes used by PostgreSQL replicas on all newly created clusters. |
| `wal_storage` |  |  | Set to configure which storage definition to use when creating volumes used for PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Log. |

#### Example Defaults

```yaml
backrest_storage: 'nfsstorage'
backup_storage: 'nfsstorage'
primary_storage: 'nfsstorage'
replica_storage: 'nfsstorage'
```

With the configuration shown above, the `nfsstorage` storage configuration would
be used by default for the various containers created for a PG cluster
(i.e. containers for the primary DB, replica DB's, backups and/or `pgBackRest`).

### Considerations for Multi-Zone Cloud Environments

When using the Operator in a Kubernetes cluster consisting of nodes that span
multiple zones, special consideration must be taken to ensure all pods and the
volumes they require are scheduled and provisioned within the same zone.  Specifically,
being that a pod is unable mount a volume that is located in another zone, any
volumes that are dynamically provisioned must be provisioned in a topology-aware
manner according to the specific scheduling requirements for the pod. For instance,
this means ensuring that the volume containing the database files for the primary
database in a new PostgreSQL cluster is provisioned in the same zone as the node
containing the PostgreSQL primary pod that will be using it.

## Pod Anti-affinity Settings
This will set the default pod anti-affinity for the deployed PostgreSQL
clusters. Pod Anti-Affinity is set to determine where the PostgreSQL Pods are
deployed relative to each other There are three levels:

- required: Pods *must* be scheduled to different Nodes. If a Pod cannot be
  scheduled to a different Node from the other Pods in the anti-affinity
  group, then it will not be scheduled.
- preferred (default): Pods *should* be scheduled to different Nodes. There is
  a chance that two Pods in the same anti-affinity group could be scheduled to
  the same node
- disabled: Pods do not have any anti-affinity rules

The `POD_ANTI_AFFINITY` label sets the Pod anti-affinity for all of the Pods
that are managed by the Operator in a PostgreSQL cluster. In addition to the
PostgreSQL Pods, this also includes the pgBackRest repository and any
pgBouncer pods. By default, the pgBackRest and pgBouncer pods inherit the
value of `POD_ANTI_AFFINITY`, but one can override the default by setting
the `POD_ANTI_AFFINITY_PGBACKREST` and `POD_ANTI_AFFINITY_PGBOUNCER` variables
for pgBackRest and pgBouncer respectively

| Name | Default | Required | Description |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `pod_anti_affinity` | preferred |  | This will set the default pod anti-affinity for the deployed PostgreSQL clusters. |
| `pod_anti_affinity_pgbackrest` |  |  | This will set the default pod anti-affinity for the pgBackRest pods. |
| `pod_anti_affinity_pgbouncer` |  |  | This will set the default pod anti-affinity for the pgBouncer pods. |

## Understanding `pgo_operator_namespace` & `namespace`

The Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator can be configured to be deployed and manage a single
namespace or manage several namespaces.  The following are examples of different types
of deployment models:

### Single Namespace

To deploy the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator to work with a single namespace (in this example
our namespace is named `pgo`), configure the following settings:

```yaml
pgo_operator_namespace: 'pgo'
namespace: 'pgo'
```

### Multiple Namespaces

To deploy the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator to work with multiple namespaces (in this example
our namespaces are named `pgo`, `pgouser1` and `pgouser2`), configure the following settings:

```yaml
pgo_operator_namespace: 'pgo'
namespace: 'pgouser1,pgouser2'
```

## Deploying Multiple Operators

The 4.0 release of the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator allows for multiple operator deployments in the same cluster.  
To install the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator to multiple namespaces, it's recommended to have an configuration file
for each deployment of the operator.

For each operator deployment the following variables should be configured uniquely for each install.

For example, operator could be deployed twice by changing the `pgo_operator_namespace` and `namespace` for those
deployments:

Install A would deploy operator to the `pgo` namespace and it would manage the `pgo` target namespace.

```yaml
# Config A
pgo_operator_namespace: 'pgo'
namespace: 'pgo'
...
```

Install B would deploy operator to the `pgo2` namespace and it would manage the `pgo2` and `pgo3` target namespaces.
```yaml
# Config B
pgo_operator_namespace: 'pgo2'
namespace: 'pgo2,pgo3'
...
```

Each install of the operator will create a corresponding directory in `$HOME/.pgo/<PGO NAMESPACE>` which will contain
the TLS and `pgouser` client credentials.
