Crunchy Data announces the release of PGO, the Postgres Operator 4.7.8.

The PostgreSQL Operator is released in conjunction with the [Crunchy Container Suite](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/).

PostgreSQL Operator 4.7.7 release includes the following software versions upgrades:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) versions 13.9, 12.13, 11.18, and 10.23 are now available.
- The [pg_partman](https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman) extension is now at version 4.7.1.
- The [TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb) extension is now at version 2.8.1.

## Fixes
- The `pgo test` command now displays `DOWN` for an PostgreSQL instance that cannot be identified as either a `primary` or a `replica`.
