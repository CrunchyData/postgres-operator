[Crunchy Data](https://www.crunchydata.com) announces the release of the [PostgreSQL Operator](https://www.crunchydata.com/products/crunchy-postgresql-operator/) 4.2.2 on February, 18, 2020.

The PostgreSQL Operator 4.2.2 release provides bug fixes and continued support to the 4.2 release line.

This release includes updates for several packages supported by the PostgreSQL Operator, including:

- The PostgreSQL containers now use versions 12.2, 11.7, 10.12, 9.6.17, and 9.5.21
- The PostgreSQL containers now support PL/Python3
- Patroni is updated to version 1.6.4

The PostgreSQL Operator is released in conjunction with the [Crunchy Container Suite](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/).

PostgreSQL Operator is tested with Kubernetes 1.13+, OpenShift 3.11+, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and VMware Enterprise PKS 1.3+.

# Changes since 4.2.1

- Added the `--enable-autofail` flag to `pgo update` to make it clear how the auto-failover mechanism can be re-enabled for a PostgreSQL cluster.
- Remove using `expenv` in the `add-targeted-namespace.sh` script

# Fixes since 4.2.1

- Ensure PostgreSQL clusters can be successfully restored via `pgo restore` after 'pgo scaledown' is executed
- Ensure all replicas are listed out via the `--query` flag in `pgo scaledown` and `pgo failover`. This now follows the pattern outlined by the [Kubernetes safe random string generator](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/rand/rand.go) (#1247)
- Honor the value of "PasswordLength" when it is set in the pgo.yaml file for password generation. The default is now set at `24`
- Set `UsePAM yes` in the `sshd_config` file to fix an issue with using SSHD in newer versions of Docker
- The backup task listed in the `pgtask` CRD is now only deleted if one already exists
- Ensure that a successful "rmdata" Job does not delete all cluster pgtasks listed in the CRD after a successful run
- Only add Operator labels to a managed namespace if the namespace already exists when executing the `add-targeted-namespace.sh` script
- Remove logging of PostgreSQL user credentials in the PostgreSQL Operator logs
- Consolidation of the Dockerfiles for RHEL7/UBI7 builds
- Several fixes to the documentation (#1233)
