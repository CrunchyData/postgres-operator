[Crunchy Data](https://www.crunchydata.com) announces the release of the [PostgreSQL Operator](https://www.crunchydata.com/products/crunchy-postgresql-operator/) 4.2.1 on January, 16, 2020.

The PostgreSQL Operator 4.2.1 provides bug fixes and continued support to the 4.2 release line.

The PostgreSQL Operator is released in conjunction with the [Crunchy Container Suite](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/).

PostgreSQL Operator is tested with Kubernetes 1.13+, OpenShift 3.11+, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and VMware Enterprise PKS 1.3+.

# Fixes

- Ensure Pod labels are updated after failover (#1218)
- Fix for scheduled tasks to continue executing even after `pgo delete schedule` is called (#1215)
- Ensure `pgo restore` carries through the `--node-label` to the new primary (#1206)
- Fix for displaying incorrect replica names with the `--query` flag on `pgo scaledown`/`pgo failover` after a failover occurred
- Fix for default CA exclusion for the Windows-based [pgo client]({{< relref "pgo-client/_index.md" >}})
- Fix a race condition where the `pgo-rmdata` job could fail when doing its final pass on deleting PVCs. This went unnoticed as it was the final task to occur
- Fix image pull policy for the `pgo-client` container to match the project default (`IfNotPresent`)
- Update the "Create CRD Example" to reference the `crunchy-postgres-ha` container
- Update comments used for the API documentation generation via Swagger
- Update the directions for running the PostgreSQL Operator from the GCP Marketplace deployer
- Updated OLM installer example and added generation script
- Update the "cron" package to `v3.0.1`
