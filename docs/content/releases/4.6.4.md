Crunchy Data announces the release of PGO, the Postgres Operator 4.6.4.

The PostgreSQL Operator is released in conjunction with the [Crunchy Container Suite](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/).

PostgreSQL Operator 4.6.4 release includes the following software versions upgrades:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) is updated to 13.4, 12.8, 11.13, 10.18, and 9.6.23.
- PL/Tcl is now included in the PostGIS (`crunchy-postgres-gis-ha`) container.

## Changes

- On using the built-in upgrade tool, the `pg-pod-anti-affinity` is now removed from the `userlabels` section of a `pgclusters.crunchydata.com` custom resource.
- Ensure `vendor` label is propagated to all PGO managed objects. Reported by (@mdraijer).

## Fixes

- Allow backup configuration to be changed when a cluster is recreated. For example, allow backup configuration to change from posix to s3 within a new cluster.
- Ensure a SQL policy that contains writes can be applied to a Postgres cluster after a failover.
