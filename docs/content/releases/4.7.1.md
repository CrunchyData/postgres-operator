Crunchy Data announces the release of PGO, the Postgres Operator 4.7.1 on July 29, 2021.

The PostgreSQL Operator is released in conjunction with the [Crunchy Container Suite](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/).

PostgreSQL Operator 4.7.1 release includes the following software versions upgrades:

- Patroni is now at 2.1.0.

## Changes

- On using the built-in upgrade tool, the `pg-pod-anti-affinity` is now removed from the `userlabels` section of a `pgclusters.crunchydata.com` custom resource.
- Ensure `vendor` label is propagated to all PGO managed objects. Reported by (@mdraijer).
- Improvements to the `pv/create-pv-nfs.sh` script, which helps with provisioning persistent volumes when using NFS storage. Contributed by Adrian Galbenus (@agalbenus).

## Fixes

- Allow backup configuration to be changed when a cluster is recreated. For example, allow backup configuration to change from posix to s3 within a new cluster.
- Ensure a SQL policy that contains writes can be applied to a Postgres cluster after a failover.
- Removed `disable_fsgroup: false` from the default installation setup. This allows the OpenShift autodetection code to work properly.
- Fix issue in pgBackRest SSHD configuration bootstrap.
