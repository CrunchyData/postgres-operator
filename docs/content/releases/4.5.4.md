Crunchy Data announces the release of PGO, the Postgres Operator 4.5.4.

The PostgreSQL Operator is released in conjunction with the [Crunchy Container Suite](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/).

PostgreSQL Operator 4.5.4 release includes the following software versions upgrades:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) is updated to 13.4, 12.8, 11.13, 10.18, and 9.6.23.
- [pgaudit_analyze](https://github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit_analyze) is now at 1.0.8.
- [set_user](https://github.com/pgaudit/set_user) is now at version 2.0.1.

# Changes

- Ensure `vendor` label is propagated to all PGO managed objects. Reported by @mdraijer.

# Fixes

- Allow backup configuration to be changed when a cluster is recreated. For example, allow backup configuration to change from `posix` to `s3` within a new cluster.
- Ensure a SQL policy that contains writes can be applied to a Postgres cluster after a failover.
