Crunchy Data announces the release of [Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes](https://www.crunchydata.com/products/crunchy-postgresql-for-kubernetes/) 5.2.0.

Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes is powered by [PGO](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator), the open source [Postgres Operator](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator) from [Crunchy Data](https://www.crunchydata.com). [PGO](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator) is released in conjunction with the [Crunchy Container Suite](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers).

Read more about how you can [get started]({{< relref "quickstart/_index.md" >}}) with Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes. We recommend [forking the Postgres Operator examples](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator-examples/fork) repo.

## Major Features

This and all PGO v5 releases are compatible with a brand new `pgo` command line interface.
Please see the [`pgo` CLI documentation](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator-client/latest)
for its release notes and more details.

## Features

- Added the ability to customize and influence the scheduling of pgBackRest backup Jobs using `affinity` and `tolerations`.
- You can now pause the reconciliation and rollout of changes to a PostgreSQL cluster using the `spec.paused` field.
- Leaf certificates provisioned by PGO as part of a PostgreSQL cluster's TLS infrastructure are now automatically rotated prior to expiration.
- PGO now has support for feature gates.
- You can now add custom sidecars to both PostgreSQL instance Pods and PgBouncer Pods using the `spec.instances.containers` and `spec.proxy.pgBouncer.containers` fields.
- It is now possible to configure standby clusters to replicate from a remote primary using streaming replication.
- Added the ability to provide a custom `nodePort` for the primary PostgreSQL, pgBouncer and pgAdmin services.
- Added the ability to define custom labels and annotations for the primary PostgreSQL, pgBouncer and pgAdmin services.

## Changes

- All containers are now run with the minimum capabilities required by the container runtime.
- The PGO documentation now includes instructions for rotating the root TLS certificate.
- A `fsGroupChangePolicy` of `OnRootMismatch` is now set on all Pods.
- The `runAsNonRoot` security setting is on every container rather than every pod.

## Fixes

- A better timeout has been set for the `pg_ctl` `start` and `stop` commands that are run during a restore.
- A restore can now be re-attempted if PGO is unable to cleanly start or stop the database during a previous restore attempt.
