## Major Features

We excited to announce v0.1 of our brand new `pgo` command line interface (CLI)!  This new versions is compatible with all currently supported PGO v5 release lines.

With a focus on day two operations and disaster recovery (DR), of the `pgo` v0.1 includes the following commands:

```bash
# Create a PostgresCluster
pgo create postgrescluster hippo

# Delete a PostgresCluster
pgo delete postgrescluster hippo

# Backup a PostgresCluster
pgo backup hippo --repoName="repo1"

# View PostgresCluster Backup Information
pgo show backup hippo --repoName="repo1"

# Restore a PostgresCluster
pgo restore hippo --repoName="repo1"
pgo restore hippo --disable

# Create a Support Export
pgo support export hippo
```

Please note that `pgo` can either be run on it's own, or as a `kubectl` plugin.  For additional details, please see the [PGO CLi documentation]().

## Features

- Added the ability to customize and influence the scheduling of pgBackRest backup Jobs using `affinity` and `tolerations`.
- You can now pause the reconciliation and rollout of changes to a PostgreSQL cluster using the `spec.paused` field.
- Leaf certificates provisioned by PGO as part of a PostgreSQL cluster's TLS infrastructure are now automatically rotated prior to expiration.
- PGO now has support for feature flags.
- You can now add custom sidecars to both PostgreSQL instance Pods and PgBouncer Pods using the `spec.instances.containers` and `spec.proxy.pgBouncer.containers` fields.
- It is now possible to configured standby clusters to replicate from a remote primary using streaming replication.
- Added the ability to provide a custom`nodePort` for the primary PostgreSQL, pgBouncer and pgAdmin services.
- Added the ability to define custom labels and annotations for the primary PostgreSQL, pgBouncer and pgAdmin services.

## Changes

- All containers are now run with the minimum capabilities required by the container runtime.
- The PGO documentation now includes instructions for rotating the root TLS certificate.
- A `fsGroupChangePolicy` of `OnRootMismatch` is now set on all Pods.

## Fixes

- A better timeout has been set for the `pg_ctl` `start` and `stop` commands that are run during a restore.
- A restore can now be re-attempted if PGO is unable to cleanly start or stop the database during a previous restore attempt.
