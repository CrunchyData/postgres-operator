Crunchy Data announces the release of PGO, the Postgres Operator 4.7.3.

The PostgreSQL Operator is released in conjunction with the [Crunchy Container Suite](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/).

PostgreSQL Operator 4.7.3 release includes the following software versions upgrades:

## Changes

- The Secret that is created when attempting a cluster bootstrap from a backup (pgo create cluster --restore-from) is now removed when the pgo-rmdata Job is invoked (i.e. pgo delete cluster).

## Fixes

- The default container tag for deploying Postgres images did not contain the proper Postgres image increment. These are now set correctly (e.g. centos8-13.4-4.7.3). Reported by Nathenael D. (@Dnathan33).
- Fix an erroneous label command when setting the vendor label on the pgo-backrest-repo-config Secret. Reported by Keith Layne (@keithlayne).
- Ensure that a Postgres cluster will continue to be upgraded if a data source is present in the pgclusters custom resource.
