Crunchy Data announces the release of the [PostgreSQL Operator](https://www.crunchydata.com/products/crunchy-postgresql-operator/) 4.4.1 on August 17, 2020.

The PostgreSQL Operator is released in conjunction with the [Crunchy Container Suite](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/).

The PostgreSQL Operator 4.4.1 release includes the following software versions upgrades:

- The PostgreSQL containers now use versions 12.4, 11.9, 10.14, 9.6.19, and 9.5.23

PostgreSQL Operator is tested with Kubernetes 1.13 - 1.18, OpenShift 3.11+, OpenShift 4.3+, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and VMware Enterprise PKS 1.3+.

## Fixes

- The pgBackRest URI style defaults to `host` if it is not set.
- Fix `pgo label` when applying multiple labels at once.
- pgBadger now has a default memory limit of 64Mi, which should help avoid a visit from the OOM killer.
- Fix `pgo create pgorole` so that the expression `--permissions=*` works.
