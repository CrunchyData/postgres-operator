Crunchy Data announces the release of [Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes](https://www.crunchydata.com/products/crunchy-postgresql-for-kubernetes/) 5.1.0.

Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes is powered by [PGO](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator), the open source [Postgres Operator](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator) from [Crunchy Data](https://www.crunchydata.com). [PGO](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator) is released in conjunction with the [Crunchy Container Suite](https://github.com/CrunchyData/container-suite).

Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes 5.1.0 includes the following software versions upgrades:

- [Patroni](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/) is now at version 2.1.3.
- [pgAdmin 4](https://www.pgadmin.org/) is now at version 4.30
- [pgBackRest](https://pgbackrest.org/) is updated to version 2.38.
- The [pgAudit](https://github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit) extension is now at version 1.6.2 (PG 14), 1.5.2 (PG 13), 1.4.3 (PG 12), 1.3.4 (PG 11) & 1.2.4 (PG 10).
- The [pgnodemx](https://github.com/CrunchyData/pgnodemx) extension is now at version 1.3.0.
- The [TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb) extension is now at version 2.6.0.

## Major Features

### pgAdmin 4 Integration

PGO v5.1 reintroduces the pgAdmin 4 integration from [PGO v4](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/4.7.5/architecture/pgadmin4/). v5.1 adds the [`spec.userInterace.pgadmin`]({{< relref "references/crd.md" >}}#postgresclusterspecuserinterfacepgadmin) section to the `PostgresCluster` custom resource to enable pgAdmin 4 integration for a Postgres cluster. Any users defined in `spec.users` are are synced with pgAdmin 4, allowing for a seamless management experience.

Please see the [pgAdmin 4 section](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/v5/architecture/pgadmin4/) of the PGO documentation for more information about this integration.

### Removal of SSH Requirement for Local Backups

Previous versions of PGO relied on the use of `ssh` to take backups and store archive files on Kubernetes-managed storage. PGO v5.1 now uses mTLS to securely transfer and manage these files.

The upgrade to pgBackRest TLS is seamless and transparent if using related image environment variables with your PGO Deployment (please see the [PostgresCluster CRD reference](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/v5/references/crd/) for more information).  This is because PGO will automatically handle updating all image tags across all existing PostgreCluster's following the upgrade to v5.1, seamlessly rolling out any new images as required for proper pgBackRest TLS functionality.

If you are not using related image environment variables, and are instead explicitly defining images via the `image` fields in your PostgresCluster spec, then an additional step is required in order to ensure a seamless upgrade.  Specifically, all `postgrescluster.spec.image` and `postgrescluster.spec.backups.pgbackrest.image` fields must first be updated to specify images containing pgBackRest 2.38.  Therefore, prior to upgrading, please update all `postgrescluster.spec.image` and `postgrescluster.spec.backups.pgbackrest.image` fields to the latest versions of the `crunchy-postgres` and `crunchy-pgbackrest` containers available per the [Components and Compatibility guide](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/v5/references/components/) (please note that the `crunchy-postgres` container should be updated to the latest version available for the major version of PostgreSQL currently being utilized within a cluster).

In the event that PGO is upgraded to v5.1 _before_ updating your image tags, simply update any `image` fields in your PostgresCluster spec as soon as possible following the upgrade.

## Features

- Set [Pod Disruption Budgets]({{< relref "architecture/high-availability.md" >}}#pod-disruption-budgets) (PDBs) for both Postgres and PgBouncer instances.
- Postgres configuration changes requiring a database restart are now automatically rolled out to all instances in the cluster.
- For rolling updates that do not require Pod recreation, e.g. applying a change that requires a database restart, PGO no longer recreates all of the database instance Pods. These types of changes are now applied more quickly.
- Support for [manual switchovers or failovers]({{< relref "tutorial/administrative-tasks.md">}}#changing-the-primary).
- Rotate PgBouncer TLS certificates without downtime.
- Add support for using Active Directory for securely authenticating with PostgreSQL using the GSSAPI.
- Support for using [AWS IAM roles with S3]({{< relref "tutorial/backups.md" >}}#using-an-aws-integrated-identity-provider-and-role) with backups when PGO is deployed in EKS.
- The characters used for password generation can now be controlled using the `postgrescluster.spec.users.password.type` parameter. Choices are `AlphaNumeric` and `ASCII`; defaults to `ASCII`.
- Introduction for automatically checking for updates for PGO and Postgres components. If an update is discovered, it is included in the PGO logs.

## Changes

- As a result of [a fix in pgBouncer v1.16](https://github.com/libusual/libusual/commit/ab960074cb7a), PGO no longer sets verbosity settings in the PgBouncer configuration to catch missing `%include` directives.  Users can increase verbosity in their own configuration files to maintain the previous behavior.
- The Postgres `archive_timeout` setting now defaults to 60 seconds (`60s`), which matches the behavior from PGO v4. If you do not require for WAL files to be generated once a minute (e.g. generally idle system where a window of data-loss is acceptable or a development system), you can set this to `0`:

```yaml
spec:
  patroni:
    dynamicConfiguration:
      postgresql:
        parameters:
          archive_timeout: 0
```
- All Pods now have `enableServiceLinks` set to `false` in order to ensure injected environment variables do not conflict with the various applications running within various PGO Pods.

## Fixes

- The name of the CronJob created for a scheduled backup has been shortened to `<cluster name>-<repo#>-<backup type>` to allow for longer PostgresCluster names.
