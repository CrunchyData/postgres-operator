Crunchy Data announces the release of [Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes](https://www.crunchydata.com/products/crunchy-postgresql-for-kubernetes/) 5.0.1.

Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes is powered by [PGO](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator), the open source [Postgres Operator](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator) from [Crunchy Data](https://www.crunchydata.com). [PGO](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator) is released in conjunction with the [Crunchy Container Suite](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/).

Crunchy Postgres for Kubernetes 5.0.1 includes the following software versions upgrades:

- [Patroni](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/) is now at 2.1.0.
- PL/Tcl is now included in the PostGIS (`crunchy-postgres-gis-ha`) container.

## Features

- Custom affinity rules and tolerations can now be added to pgBackRest restore Jobs.
- OLM bundles can now be generated for PGO 5.

## Changes

- The `replicas` value for an instance set must now be greater than `0`, and at least one instance set must now be defined for a `PostgresCluster`.  This is to prevent the cluster from being scaled down to `0` instances, since doing so results in the inability to scale the cluster back up.
- Refreshed the PostgresCluster CRD documentation using the latest version of `crdoc` (`v0.3.0`).
- The PGO test suite now includes a test to validate image pull secrets.
- Related Image functionality has been implemented for the OLM installer as required to support offline deployments.
- The name of the PGO Deployment and ServiceAccount has been changed to `pgo` for all installers, allowing both PGO v4.x and PGO v5.x to be run in the same namespace.  If you are using Kustomize to install PGO and are upgrading from PGO 5.0.0, please see the [Upgrade Guide]({{< relref "../installation/upgrade.md" >}}) for addtional steps that must be completed as a result of this change in order to ensure a successful upgrade.
- PGO now automatically detects whether or not it is running in an OpenShift environment.
- Postgres users and databases can be specified in `PostgresCluster.spec.users`. The credentials stored in the `{cluster}-pguser` Secret are still valid, but they are no longer reconciled. References to that Secret should be replaced with `{cluster}-pguser-{cluster}`. Once all references are updated, the old `{cluster}-pguser` Secret can be deleted.
- The built-in `postgres` superuser can now be managed the same way as other users. Specifying it in `PostgresCluster.spec.users` will give it a password, allowing it to connect over the network.
- PostgreSQL data and pgBackRest repo volumes are now reconciled using labels.

## Fixes

- It is now possible to customize `shared_preload_libraries` when monitoring is enabled.
- Fixed a typo in the description of the `openshift` field in the PostgresCluster CRD.
- When a new cluster is created using an existing PostgresCluster as its dataSource, the original primary for that cluster will now properly initialize as a replica following a switchover. This is fixed with the upgrade to Patroni 2.1.0).
- A consistent `startupInstance` name is now set in the PostgresCluster status when bootstrapping a new cluster using an existing PostgresCluster as its data source.
- It is now possible to properly customize the `pg_hba.conf` configuration file.
