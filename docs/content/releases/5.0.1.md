## Changes

- The `replicas` value for an instance set must now be greater than `0`, and at least one instance set must now be defined for a `PostgresCluster`.  This is to prevent the cluster from being scaled down to `0` instances, since doing so results in the inability to scale the cluster back up.
- Refreshed the PostgresCluster CRD documentation using the latest version of `crdoc` (`v0.3.0`).
- The PGO test suite now includes a test to validate image pull secrets.
- Related Image functionality has been implemented for the OLM installer as required to support offline deployments.
- The name of the PGO Deployment and ServiceAccount has been changed to `pgo` for all installers, allowing both PGO v4.x and PGO v5.x to be run in the same namespace.
- Custom affinity rules and tolerations can now be added to pgBackRest restore Jobs.
- PGO now automatically detects whether or not it is running in an OpenShift environment.
- OLM bundles can now be generated for PGO v5.x.
- Postgres users and databases can be specified in `PostgresCluster.spec.users`.
  The credentials stored in the `{cluster}-pguser` Secret are still valid, but
  they are no longer reconciled. References to that Secret should be replaced
  with `{cluster}-pguser-{cluster}`. Once all references are updated, the old
  `{cluster}-pguser` Secret can be deleted.
- The built-in `postgres` superuser can now be managed the same way as other users.
  Specifying it in `PostgresCluster.spec.users` will give it a password, allowing
  it to connect over the network.

## Fixes

- It is now possible to customize `shared_preload_libraries` when monitoring is enabled.
- Fixed a typo in the description of the `openshift` field in the PostgresCluster CRD.
- When a new cluster is created using an existing PostgresCluster as its dataSource, the original primary for that cluster will now properly initialize as a replica following a switchover. This is fixed with the upgrade to Patroni 2.1.0).
- A consistent `startupInstance` name is now set in the PostgresCluster status when bootstrapping a new cluster using an existing PostgresCluster as its data source.
