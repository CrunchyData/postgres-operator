## PostgreSQL Operator Containers Overview

The PostgreSQL Operator orchestrates a series of PostgreSQL and PostgreSQL related containers containers that enable rapid deployment of PostgreSQL, including administration and monitoring tools in a Kubernetes environment. The PostgreSQL Operator supports PostgreSQL 9.5+ with multiple PostgreSQL cluster deployment strategies and a variety of PostgreSQL related extensions and tools enabling enterprise grade PostgreSQL-as-a-Service.   A full list of the containers supported by the PostgreSQL Operator is provided below.   

### PostgreSQL Server, Tools, and Extensions

* **PostgreSQL** (crunchy-postgres-ha).  PostgreSQL database server.  The crunchy-postgres container image is unmodified, open source PostgreSQL packaged and maintained by Crunchy Data. The container supports PostgreSQL tools by running in different modes, more information on running modes can be found in the [Crunchy Container](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/crunchy-postgres-containers/latest/) documentation. The PostgreSQL operator uses the following running modes:

    - **pgdump** (MODE: pgdump) running in pgdump mode, the image executes either a pg_dump or pg_dumpall database backup against another PostgreSQL database.
    - **pgrestore** (MODE: pgrestore) running in pgrestore mode, the image provides a means of performing a restore of a dump from pg_dump or pg_dumpall via psql or pg_restore to a PostgreSQL container database.
    - **sqlrunner** (MODE: sqlrunner) running in sqlrunner mode, the image will use `psql` to issue specified queries, defined in SQL files, to a PostgreSQL container database.

* **PostGIS** (crunchy-postgres-ha-gis).  PostgreSQL database server including the PostGIS extension. The crunchy-postgres-gis container image is unmodified, open source PostgreSQL packaged and maintained by Crunchy Data. This image is identical to the crunchy-postgres image except it includes the open source geospatial extension PostGIS for PostgreSQL in addition to the language extension PL/R which allows for writing functions in the R statistical computing language.

### Backup and Restore

* **pgBackRest** (crunchy-postgres-ha). pgBackRest is a high performance backup and restore utility for PostgreSQL.  The crunchy-postgres-ha container executes the pgBackRest utility, allowing FULL and DELTA restore capability.

### Administration Tools

* **pgAdmin4** (crunchy-pgadmin4). PGAdmin4 is a graphical user interface administration tool for PostgreSQL.  The crunchy-pgadmin4 container executes the pgAdmin4 web application.

* **pgbadger** (crunchy-pgbadger).  pgbadger is a PostgreSQL log analyzer with fully detailed reports and graphs.  The crunchy-pgbadger container executes the pgBadger utility, which generates a PostgreSQL log analysis report using a small HTTP server running on the container.

* **pg_upgrade**  (crunchy-upgrade). The crunchy-upgrade container contains 9.5, 9.6, 10, 11 and 12 PostgreSQL packages in order to perform a pg_upgrade from 9.5 to 9.6, 9.6 to 10, 10 to 11, and 11 to 12 versions.

* **scheduler** (crunchy-scheduler).  The crunchy-scheduler container provides a cron like microservice for automating pgBackRest backups within a single namespace.

### Metrics and Monitoring

* **Metrics Collection** (crunchy-postgres-exporter). The crunchy-postgres-exporter container provides real time metrics about the PostgreSQL database via an API. These metrics are scraped and stored by a Prometheus time-series database and are then graphed and visualized through the open source data visualizer Grafana.  

* **Grafana** (grafana).  Hosts an open source web-based graphing dashboard called Grafana.  Provides visual dashboards for monitoring PostgreSQL clusters, specifically using Crunchy PostgreSQL Exporter data stored within Prometheus.

* **Prometheus** (prometheus).  Prometheus is a multi-dimensional time series data model with an elastic query language. It is used in collaboration with the Crunchy PostgreSQL Exporter and Grafana to provide and store metrics.

* **Alertmanager** (alertmanager). Handles alerts sent by Prometheus by deduplicating, grouping, and routing them to reciever integrations.

### Connection Pooling

* **pgbouncer** (crunchy-pgbouncer).  pgbouncer is a lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL. The crunchy-pgbouncer container provides a pgbouncer image.
