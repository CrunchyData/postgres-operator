The goal of the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator is to provide a means to quickly get
your applications up and running on PostgreSQL for both development and
production environments. To understand how the PostgreSQL Operator does this, we
want to give you a tour of its architecture, with explains both the architecture
of the PostgreSQL Operator itself as well as recommended deployment models for
PostgreSQL in production!

# Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator Architecture

![Operator Architecture with CRDs](/Operator-Architecture-wCRDs.png)

The Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator extends Kubernetes to provide a higher-level
abstraction for rapid creation and management of PostgreSQL clusters.  The
Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator leverages a Kubernetes concept referred to as
"[Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)‚Äù
to create several
[custom resource definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions)
that allow for the management of PostgreSQL clusters.

The Custom Resource Definitions include:

- `pgclusters.crunchydata.com`: Stores information required to manage a
PostgreSQL cluster. This includes things like the cluster name, what storage and
resource classes to use, which version of PostgreSQL to run, information about
how to maintain a high-availability cluster, etc.
- `pgreplicas.crunchydata.com`: Stores information required to manage the
replicas within a PostgreSQL cluster. This includes things like the number of
replicas, what storage and resource classes to use, special affinity rules, etc.
- `pgtasks.crunchydata.com`: A general purpose CRD that accepts a type of task
that is needed to run against a cluster (e.g. take a backup) and tracks the
state of said task through its workflow.
- `pgpolicies.crunchydata.com`: Stores a reference to a SQL file that can be
executed against a PostgreSQL cluster. In the past, this was used to manage RLS
policies on PostgreSQL clusters.

There are also a few legacy Custom Resource Definitions that the PostgreSQL
Operator comes with that will be removed in a future release.

The PostgreSQL Operator runs as a deployment in a namespace and is composed of
up to four Pods, including:

- `operator` (image: postgres-operator) - This is the heart of the PostgreSQL
Operator. It contains a series of Kubernetes
[controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) that
place watch events on a series of native Kubernetes resources (Jobs, Pods) as
well as the Custom Resources that come with the PostgreSQL Operator (Pgcluster,
Pgtask)
- `apiserver` (image: pgo-apiserver) - This provides an API that a PostgreSQL
Operator User (`pgouser`) can interface with via the `pgo` command-line
interface (CLI) or directly via HTTP requests. The API server can also control
what resources a user can access via a series of RBAC rules that can be defined
as part of a `pgorole`.
- `scheduler` (image: pgo-scheduler) - A container that runs `cron` and allows a
user to schedule repeatable tasks, such as backups (because it is important to
  schedule backups in a production environment!)
- `event` (image: pgo-event, optional) - A container that provides an interface
to the `nsq` message queue and transmits information about lifecycle events that
occur within the PostgreSQL Operator (e.g. a cluster is created, a backup is
taken, etc.)

The main purpose of the PostgreSQL Operator is to create and update information
around the structure of a PostgreSQL Cluster, and to relay information about the
overall status and health of a PostgreSQL cluster. The goal is to also simplify
this process as much as possible for users. For example, let's say we want to
create a high-availability PostgreSQL cluster that has a single replica,
supports having backups in both a local storage area and Amazon S3 and has
built-in metrics and connection pooling, similar to:

![PostgreSQL HA Cluster](/images/postgresql-cluster-ha-s3.png)

We can accomplish that with a single command:

```shell
pgo create cluster hacluster --replica-count=1 --metrics --pgbackrest-storage-type="posix,s3" --pgbouncer --pgbadger
```

The PostgreSQL Operator handles setting up all of the various Deployments and
sidecars to be able to accomplish this task, and puts in the various constructs
to maximize resiliency of the PostgreSQL cluster.

You will also notice that **high-availability is enabled by default**. The
Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator uses a distributed-consensus method for PostgreSQL
cluster high-availability, and as such delegates the management of each
cluster's availability to the clusters themselves. This removes the PostgreSQL
Operator from being a single-point-of-failure, and has benefits such as faster
recovery times for each PostgreSQL cluster. For a detailed discussion on
high-availability, please see the [High-Availability](/architecture/high-availability)
section.

Every single Kubernetes object (Deployment, Service, Pod, Secret, Namespace,
etc.) that is deployed or managed by the PostgreSQL Operator has a Label
associated with the name of `vendor` and a value of `crunchydata`. You can
use Kubernetes selectors to easily find out which objects are being watched by
the PostgreSQL Operator. For example, to get all of the managed Secrets in the
default namespace the PostgreSQL Operator is deployed into (`pgo`):

```shell
kubectl get secrets -n pgo --selector=vendor=crunchydata
```

## Kubernetes Deployments: The Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator Deployment Model

The Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator uses [Kubernetes Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)
for running PostgreSQL clusters instead of StatefulSets or other objects. This
is by design: Kubernetes Deployments allow for more flexibility in how you
deploy your PostgreSQL clusters.

For example, let's look at a specific PostgreSQL cluster where we want to have
one primary instance and one replica instance. We want to ensure that our
primary instance is using our fastest disks and has more compute resources
available to it. We are fine with our replica having slower disks and less
compute resources. We can create this environment with a command similar to
below:

```shell
pgo create cluster mixed --replica-count=1 \
  --storage-config=fast --memory=32Gi --cpu=8.0 \
  --replica-storage-config=standard
```

Now let's say we want to have one replica available to run read-only queries
against, but we want its hardware profile to mirror that of the primary
instance. We can run the following command:

```shell
pgo scale mixed --replica-count=1 \
  --storage-config=fast
```

Kubernetes Deployments allow us to create heterogeneous clusters with ease and
let us scale them up and down as we please. Additional components in our
PostgreSQL cluster, such as the pgBackRest repository or an optional pgBouncer,
are deployed as Kubernetes Deployments as well.

We can also leverage Kubernees Deployments to apply
[Node Affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity)
rules to individual PostgreSQL instances. For instance, we may want to force one
or more of our PostgreSQL replicas to run on Nodes in a different region than
our primary PostgreSQL instances.

Using Kubernetes Deployments does create additional management complexity, but
the good news is: the PostgreSQL Operator manages it for you! Being aware of
this model can help you understand how the PostgreSQL Operator gives you maximum
flexibility for your PostgreSQL clusters while giving you the tools to
troubleshoot issues in production.

The last piece of this model is the use of [Kubernetes Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
for accessing your PostgreSQL clusters and their various components. The
PostgreSQL Operator puts services in front of each Deployment to ensure you have
a known, consistent means of accessing your PostgreSQL components.

Note that in some production environments, there can be delays in accessing
Services during transition events. The PostgreSQL Operator attempts to mitigate
delays during critical operations (e.g. failover, restore, etc.) by directly
accessing the Kubernetes Pods to perform given actions.

# Additional Architecture Information

There is certainly a lot to unpack in the overall architecture of the Crunchy
PostgreSQL Operator. Understanding the architecture will help you to plan
the deployment model that is best for your environment. For more information on
