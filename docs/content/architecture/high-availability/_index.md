One of the great things about PostgreSQL is its reliability: it is very stable
and typically "just works." However, there are certain things that can happen in
the environment that PostgreSQL is deployed in that can affect its uptime,
including:

- The database storage disk fails or some other hardware failure occurs
- The network on which the database resides becomes unreachable
- The host operating system becomes unstable and crashes
- A key database file becomes corrupted
- A data center is lost

There may also be downtime events that are due to the normal case of operations,
such as performing a minor upgrade, security patching of operating system,
hardware upgrade, or other maintenance.

Fortunately, the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator is prepared for this.

![PostgreSQL Operator High-Availability Overview](/images/postgresql-ha-overview.png)

The Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator supports a distributed-consensus based
high-availability (HA) system that keeps its managed PostgreSQL clusters up and
running, even if the PostgreSQL Operator disappears. Additionally, it leverages
Kubernetes specific features such as
[Pod Anti-Affinity](#how-the-crunchy-postgresql-operator-uses-pod-anti-affinity)
to limit the surface area that could lead to a PostgreSQL cluster becoming
unavailable. The PostgreSQL Operator also supports automatic healing of failed
primaries and leverages the efficient pgBackRest "delta restore" method, which
eliminates the need to fully reprovision a failed cluster!

The Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator also maintains high-availability during a
routine task such as a PostgreSQL minor version upgrade.

For workloads that are sensitive to transaction loss, the Crunchy PostgreSQL
Operator supports PostgreSQL synchronous replication, which can be specified
with the `--sync-replication` when using the `pgo create cluster` command.

(HA is enabled by default in any newly created PostgreSQL cluster. You can
update this setting by either using the `--disable-autofail` flag when using
`pgo create cluster`, or modify the `pgo-config` ConfigMap [or the `pgo.yaml`
file] to set `DisableAutofail` to `"true"`. These can also be set when a
PostgreSQL cluster is running using the `pgo update cluster` command).

One can also choose to manually failover using the `pgo failover` command as
well.

The high-availability backing for your PostgreSQL cluster is only as good as
your high-availability backing for Kubernetes. To learn more about creating a
[high-availability Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/highly-available-master/),
please review the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/highly-available-master/)
or consult your systems administrator.

## The Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator High-Availability Algorithm

A critical aspect of any production-grade PostgreSQL deployment is a reliable
and effective high-availability (HA) solution. Organizations want to know that
their PostgreSQL deployments can remain available despite various issues that
have the potential to disrupt operations, including hardware failures, network
outages, software errors, or even human mistakes.

The key portion of high-availability that the PostgreSQL Operator provides is
that it delegates the management of HA to the PostgreSQL clusters themselves.
This ensures that the PostgreSQL Operator is not a single-point of failure for
the availability of any of the PostgreSQL clusters that it manages, as the
PostgreSQL Operator is only maintaining the definitions of what should be in the
cluster (e.g. how many instances in the cluster, etc.).

Each HA PostgreSQL cluster maintains its availability using concepts that come
from the [Raft algorithm](https://raft.github.io/) to achieve distributed
consensus. The Raft algorithm ("Reliable, Replicated, Redundant,
Fault-Tolerant") was developed for systems that have one "leader" (i.e. a
primary) and one-to-many followers (i.e. replicas) to provide the same fault
tolerance and safety as the PAXOS algorithm while being easier to implement.

For the PostgreSQL cluster group to achieve distributed consensus on who the
primary (or leader) is, each PostgreSQL cluster leverages the distributed etcd
key-value store that is bundled with Kubernetes. After it is elected as the
leader, a primary will place a lock in the distributed etcd cluster to indicate
that it is the leader. The "lock" serves as the method for the primary to
provide a heartbeat: the primary will periodically update the lock with the
latest time it was able to access the lock. As long as each replica sees that
the lock was updated within the allowable automated failover time, the replicas
will continue to follow the leader.

The "log replication" portion that is defined in the Raft algorithm is handled
by PostgreSQL in two ways. First, the primary instance will replicate changes to
each replica based on the rules set up in the provisioning process. For
PostgreSQL clusters that leverage "synchronous replication," a transaction is
not considered complete until all changes from those transactions have been sent
to all replicas that are subscribed to the primary.

In the above section, note the key word that the transaction are sent to each
replica: the replicas will acknowledge receipt of the transaction, but they may
not be immediately replayed. We will address how we handle this further down in
this section.

During this process, each replica keeps track of how far along in the recovery
process it is using a "log sequence number" (LSN), a built-in PostgreSQL serial
representation of how many logs have been replayed on each replica. For the
purposes of HA, there are two LSNs that need to be considered: the LSN for the
last log received by the replica, and the LSN for the changes replayed for the
replica. The LSN for the latest changes received can be compared amongst the
replicas to determine which one has replayed the most changes, and an important
part of the automated failover process.

The replicas periodically check in on the lock to see if it has been updated by
the primary within the allowable automated failover timeout. Each replica checks
in at a randomly set interval, which is a key part of Raft algorithm that helps
to ensure consensus during an election process. If a replica believes that the
primary is unavailable, it becomes a candidate and initiates an election and
votes for itself as the new primary. A candidate must receive a majority of
votes in a cluster in order to be elected as the new primary.

There are several cases for how the election can occur. If a replica believes
that a primary is down and starts an election, but the primary is actually not
down, the replica will not receive enough votes to become a new primary and will
go back to following and replaying the changes from the primary.

In the case where the primary is down, the first replica to notice this starts
an election. Per the Raft algorithm, each available replica compares which one
has the latest changes available, based upon the LSN of the latest logs
received. The replica with the latest LSN wins and receives the vote of the
other replica. The replica with the majority of the votes wins. In the event
that two replicas' logs have the same LSN, the tie goes to the replica that
initiated the voting request.

Once an election is decided, the winning replica is immediately promoted to be a
primary and takes a new lock in the distributed etcd cluster. If the new primary
has not finished replaying all of its transactions logs, it must do so in order
to reach the desired state based on the LSN. Once the logs are finished being
replayed, the primary is able to accept new queries.

At this point, any existing replicas are updated to follow the new primary.

When the old primary tries to become available again, it realizes that it has
been deposed as the leader and must be healed. The old primary determines what
kind of replica it should be based upon the CRD, which allows it to set itself
up with appropriate attributes.  It is then restored from the pgBackRest backup
archive using the "delta restore" feature, which heals the instance and makes it
ready to follow the new primary, which is known as "auto healing."

## How The Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator Uses Pod Anti-Affinity

By default, when a new PostgreSQL cluster is created using the PostgreSQL
Operator, pod anti-affinity rules will be applied to any deployments comprising
the full PG cluster (please note that default pod anti-affinity does not apply
to any Kubernetes jobs created by the PostgreSQL Operator). This includes:

- The primary PG deployment
- The deployments for each PG replica
- The `pgBackrest` dedicated repository deployment
- The `pgBouncer` deployment (if enabled for the cluster)

There are three types of Pod Anti-Affinity rules that the Crunchy PostgreSQL
Operator supports:

- `preferred`: Kubernetes will try to schedule any pods within a PostgreSQL
cluster to different nodes, but in the event it must schedule two pods on the
same Node, it will. As described above, this is the default option.
- `required`: Kubernetes will schedule pods within a PostgreSQL cluster to
different Nodes, but in the event it cannot schedule a pod to a different Node,
it will not schedule the pod until a different node is available. While this
guarantees that no pod will share the same node, it can also lead to downtime
events as well. This uses the `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`
affinity rule.
- `disabled`: Pod Anti-Affinity is not used.

With the default `preferred` Pod Anti-Affinity rule enabled, Kubernetes will
attempt to schedule pods created by each of the separate deployments above on a
unique node, but will not guarantee that this will occur. This ensures that the
pods comprising the PostgreSQL cluster can always be scheduled, though perhaps
not always on the desired node.  This is specifically done using the following:

- The `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` affinity type, which
defines an anti-affinity rule that Kubernetes will attempt to adhere to, but
will not guarantee will occur during Pod scheduling
- A combination of labels that uniquely identify the pods created by the various
Deployments listed above
- A topology key of `kubernetes.io/hostname`, which instructs Kubernetes to
schedule a pod on specific Node only if there is not already another pod in the
PostgreSQL cluster scheduled on that same Node

If you want to explicitly create a PostgreSQL cluster with the `preferred` Pod
Anti-Affinity rule, you can execute the `pgo create` command using the
`--pod-anti-affinity` flag similar to this:

```shell
pgo create cluster hacluster --replica-count=2 --pod-anti-affinity=preferred
```

or it can also be explicitly enabled globally for all clusters by setting
`PodAntiAffinity` to `preferred` in the `pgo.yaml` configuration file.

If you want to create a PostgreSQL cluster with the `required` Pod Anti-Affinity
rule, you can execute a command similar to this:

```shell
pgo create cluster hacluster --replica-count=2 --pod-anti-affinity=required
```

or set the `required` option globally for all clusters by setting
`PodAntiAffinity` to `required` in the `pgo.yaml` configuration file.

When `required` is utilized for the default pod anti-affinity, a separate node
is required for each deployment listed above comprising the PG cluster.  This
ensures that the cluster remains highly-available by ensuring that node failures
do not impact any other deployments in the cluster. However, this does mean that
the PostgreSQL primary, each PostgreSQL replica, the pgBackRest repository and,
if deployed, the pgBouncer Pods will each require a unique node, meaning
the minimum number of Nodes required for the Kubernetes cluster will increase as
more Pods are added to the PostgreSQL cluster.  Further, if an insufficient
number of nodes are available to support this configuration, certain deployments
will fail, since it will not be possible for Kubernetes to successfully schedule
the pods for each deployment.

## Synchronous Replication: Guarding Against Transactions Loss

Clusters managed by the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator can be deployed with
synchronous replication, which is useful for workloads that are sensitive to
losing transactions, as PostgreSQL will not consider a transaction to be
committed until it is committed to all synchronous replicas connected to a
primary. This provides a higher guarantee of data consistency and, when a
healthy synchronous replica is present, a guarantee of the most up-to-date data
during a failover event.

This comes at a cost of performance: PostgreSQL has to wait for
a transaction to be committed on all synchronous replicas, and a connected client
will have to wait longer than if the transaction only had to be committed on the
primary (which is how asynchronous replication works). Additionally, there is a
potential impact to availability: if a synchronous replica crashes, any writes
to the primary will be blocked until a replica is promoted to become a new
synchronous replica of the primary.

You can enable synchronous replication by using the `--sync-replication` flag
with the `pgo create` command, e.g.:


```shell
pgo create cluster hacluster --replica-count=2 --sync-replication
```

## Node Affinity

Kubernetes [Node Affinity](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#node-affinity)
can be used to scheduled Pods to specific Nodes within a Kubernetes cluster.
This can be useful when you want your PostgreSQL instances to take advantage of
specific hardware (e.g. for geospatial applications) or if you want to have a
replica instance deployed to a specific region within your Kubernetes cluster
for high-availability purposes.

The PostgreSQL Operator provides users with the ability to apply Node Affinity
rules using the `--node-label` flag on the `pgo create` and the `pgo scale`
commands. Node Affinity directs Kubernetes to attempt to schedule these
PostgreSQL instances to the specified Node label.

To get a list of available Node labels:

```
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
```

You can then specify one of those Kubernetes node names (e.g. `region=us-east-1`)
when creating a PostgreSQL cluster;

```
pgo create cluster thatcluster --node-label=region=us-east-1
```

The Node Affinity only uses the `preferred` scheduling strategy (similar to what
is described in the Pod Anti-Affinity section above), so if a Pod cannot be
scheduled to a particular Node matching the label, it will be scheduled to a
different Node.
