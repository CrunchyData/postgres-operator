## Storage and the PostgreSQL Operator

The PostgreSQL Operator allows for a variety of different configurations of persistent storage that can be leveraged by the PostgreSQL instances or clusters it deploys.

The PostgreSQL Operator works with several different storage types, HostPath, Network File System(NFS), and Dynamic storage.

* Hostpath is the simplest storage and useful for single node testing.

* NFS provides the ability to do single and multi-node testing.  

Hostpath and NFS both require you to configure persistent volumes so that you can make claims towards those volumes.  You will need to monitor the persistent volumes so that you do not run out of available volumes to make claims against.

Dynamic storage classes provide a means for users to request persistent volume claims and have the persistent volume dynamically created for you. You will need to monitor disk space with dynamic storage to make sure there is enough space for users to request a volume. There are multiple providers of dynamic storage classes to choose from. You will need to configure what works for your environment and size the Physical Volumes, Persistent Volumes (PVs), appropriately.

Once you have determined the type of storage you will plan on using and setup PVâ€™s you need to configure the Operator to know about it.  You will do this in the pgo.yaml file.  

If you are deploying to a cloud environment with multiple zones, for instance Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), you will want to review topology aware storage class configurations.
