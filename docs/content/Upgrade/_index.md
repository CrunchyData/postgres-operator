# Upgrading the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator

There are two methods for upgrading your existing deployment of the PostgreSQL Operator.

If you are upgrading from PostgreSQL Operator 4.1.0 or later, you are encouraged to use the [Automated Upgrade Procedure](/upgrade/automatedupgrade). This method simplifies the upgrade process, as well as maintains your existing clusters in place prior to their upgrade.

For versions before 4.1.0, please see the appropriate [manual procedure](/upgrade/manual).
