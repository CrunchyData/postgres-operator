== pgo.yaml

2.7 changed the pgo.yaml file to remove Debug flag

=== Required Changes

You can remove Pgo.Debug from the pgo.yaml file, the debug flag is
now called CRUNCHY_DEBUG and is set in the deployment.json file as
an environment variable.

== Container Resources

Release 2.7 added the concept of container resource configurations
to the *pgo.yaml* file.

=== Required Changes

If you want to specify container resource configurations, which are
optional, you can add a section as follows to your *pgo.yaml* file:
....
DefaultContainerResource: small
ContainerResources:
  small:
    RequestsMemory:  2Gi
    RequestsCPU:  0.5
    LimitsMemory:  2Gi
    LimitsCPU:  1.0
  large:
    RequestsMemory:  8Gi
    RequestsCPU:  2.0
    LimitsMemory:  12Gi
    LimitsCPU:  4.0
....

Be careful with these settings, you can cause your deployments to
go into a *pending* state if your Kube cluster can not meet these
memory and CPU requirements!

== Kube RBAC

Release 2.7 added a *rbac.yaml* file to capture the Kube RBAC
rules applied to enable the *apiserver* and *postgres-operator*
containers access to the Kube resources required for
the operator to work.

=== Required Changes

As part of your deployment process, you will execute
the *rbac.yaml* file to set the roles and bindings required
by the operator.  Adjust these to suit your local security
requirements.

== Application RBAC

Release 2.7 added an RBAC capability to secure the *pgo*
application.  

=== Required Changes

The *pgouser* now has a role appended at the end of
of each user definition as follows:
....
username:password:pgoadmin
testuser:testpass:pgoadmin
readonlyuser:testpass:pgoreader
....

To match the behavior of the pre 2.7 releases, the *pgadmin* role
is set on the previous user definitions, but a *readonlyuser* is
now defined to test other role definitions.

You will want to adjust these default settings to meet your
local security requirements.

The roles are defined in a new file called *pgorole*.  This
file defines each role and the permissions for that role.  By
default, two roles are defined as samples:
....
pgoadmin
pgoreader
....

You can adjust these to meet your local security requirements.  The
format of this file is as follows:
....
rolename: permissionA, permissionB
....

The complete set of permissions is documented in the Operator Documentation.


== pgo create user	

Release 2.7 added the *pgo create user* command to be more like
the other pgo commands.  The previous form of this command *pgo user --add*
has been removed.

Any scripts you wrote using the older style of command would need
to be updated to use the new command syntax.


== pgreplica CRD

There is a new CRD to hold replica information, pgreplicas.  This
CRD is populated with the *pgo scale* command.  The pgreplica
is used to hold per-replica specific information such as the
resource and storage configurations requested at run time.
