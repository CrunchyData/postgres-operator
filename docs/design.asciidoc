== Reference Architecture

So, what does the Postgres Operator actually deploy
when you create a cluster?

image::OperatorReferenceDiagram.png?raw=true[]

On this diagram, objects with dashed lines are things
that are optionally deployed as part of a Postgres Cluster
by the Operator and objects with solid lines are
the fundamental and required components.

For example, within the Primary Deployment, the *metrics* container
is completely optional, you can deploy that component using
Operator configuration or command line arguments if you want
to cause metrics to be collected from the Postgres container.

Replica deployments are just like the Primary deployment but
are optional.  You do not have to create a Replica at all 
unless you need that capability.  As you scale up your Postgres
cluster, the  standard set of components gets deployed and
replication to the Primary is started.

Lastly, in a future release, you will be able to optionally
deploy a Pgpool service and Deployment that can act as a
SQL *router* to your Postgres cluster.

Notice that each cluster deployment gets its own unique
Persistent Volumes.  Each volume can use different storage
configurations which is quite powerful.

== Custom Resource Definitions

Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions are used in the design
of the postgres Operator to define:

 * Cluster - *pgclusters*
 * Backup - *pgbackups*
 * Upgrade - *pgupgrades*
 * Policy - *pgpolicies*
 * Tasks - *pgtasks*

A PostgreSQL Cluster is made up of multiple Deployments and Services.  Optionally you can add a metrics collection container to your database pods.


== Command Line Interface

The pgo command line interface (CLI) is used by a normal end-user
to create databases or clusters, or make changes to existing databases.

The CLI interacts interacts with the *apiserver* REST API deployed
within the *postgres-operator* Deployment.

From the CLI, users can view existing clusters that
were deployed using the CLI and Operator.  Objects that were
not created by the Crunchy Operator are now viewable from the CLI.

== Operator Deployment

The postgres Operator runs within a Deployment in the Kubernetes
cluster.  An administrator will deploy the postgres Operator Deployment
using the provided script.  Once installed and running, the Operator
pod will start watching for certain defined events.

The operator watches for create/update/delete actions on
the *pgcluster* custom resource definitions.  When
the CLI creates for example a new *pgcluster* custom resource
definition, the operator catches that event and creates pods and services
for that new cluster request.

== CLI Design

The CLI uses the cobra package to implement CLI functionality
like help text, config file processing, and command line parsing.

The *pgo* client is essentially a REST client which communicates
to the *pgo-apiserver* REST server running within the Operator pod.  In
some cases you might want to split the apiserver out into its own 
Deployment but the default deployment has a consolidated pod
that contains both the apiserver and operator containers simply for
convenience of deployment and updates.

=== Verbs

A user works with the CLI by entering verbs to indicate
what they want to do, as follows:
[source,bash]
----
pgo show cluster all
pgo delete cluster db1 db2 db3
pgo create cluster mycluster
----

In the above example, the *show*, *backup*, *delete*, and *create* verbs are used.  The CLI is case sensitive and supports only lowercase.

== Affinity

You can have the Operator add an affinity section to
a new Cluster Deployment if you want to cause Kube to
attempt to schedule a Primary cluster to a specific Kube node.

You can see the nodes on your Kube cluster by:
....
kubectl get nodes
....

You can then specify one of those names (e.g. kubeadm-node2)  when creating a cluster:
....
pgo create cluster thatcluster --node-name=kubeadm-node2
....

The affinity rule inserted in the Deployment will used a *preferred*
strategy so that if the node were down or not available, Kube would
go ahead and schedule the Pod on another node.

You can always view the actual node your cluster pod is scheduled
on by:
....
kubectl get pod -o wide
....

When you scale up a Cluster and add a replica, the scaling will
take into account the use of ``--node-name''.  If it sees that a
cluster was created with a specific node name, then the replica
Deployment will add an affinity rule to attempt to schedule
the replica on a different node than the node the primary is
schedule on.  This gets you a simple for of High Availability so
that your primary and replicas will not live on the same Kube node.


== Debugging

To see if the operator pod is running enter the following:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pod -l 'name=postgres-operator'
----

To verify the operator is running and has deployed the Custom Resources execute the following:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get crd
NAME                               KIND
pgbackups.cr.client-go.k8s.io      CustomResourceDefinition.v1beta1.apiextensions.k8s.io
pgclusters.cr.client-go.k8s.io     CustomResourceDefinition.v1beta1.apiextensions.k8s.io
pgpolicies.cr.client-go.k8s.io     CustomResourceDefinition.v1beta1.apiextensions.k8s.io
pgpolicylogs.cr.client-go.k8s.io   CustomResourceDefinition.v1beta1.apiextensions.k8s.io
pgupgrades.cr.client-go.k8s.io     CustomResourceDefinition.v1beta1.apiextensions.k8s.io
pgtasks.cr.client-go.k8s.io        CustomResourceDefinition.v1beta1.apiextensions.k8s.io
----


== Persistent Volumes

Currently the operator does not delete persistent volumes by default, it will
delete the claims on the volumes.  Starting with release 2.4, the Operator
will create Jobs that actually run *rm* commands on the data volumes before
actually removing the Persistent Volumes 
if the user passes a *--delete-data* flag when deleting a database
cluster.

Likewise, if the user passes *--delete-backups* during cluster deletion
a Job is created to remove all the backups for a cluster include
the related Persistent Volume.

== PostgreSQL Operator Deployment Strategies


This section describes the various deployment strategies
offered by the operator.  A deployment in this case is
the set of objects created in Kubernetes when a
custom resource definition of type *pgcluster* is created.
CRDs are created by the pgo client command and acted upon
by the postgres operator.

=== Strategies

To support different types of deployments, the operator supports
multiple strategy implementations.  Currently there is
only a default *cluster* strategy.

In the future, more deployment strategies will be supported
to offer users more customization to what they see deployed
in their Kube cluster.

Being open source, users can also write their own strategy!

=== Specifying a Strategy

In the pgo client configuration file, there is a
*CLUSTER.STRATEGY* setting.  The current value of the
default strategy is *1*.  If you don't set that value, the
default strategy is assumed.  If you set that value to something
not supported, the operator will log an error.

=== Strategy Template Files

Each strategy supplies its set of templates used by the operator
to create new pods, services, etc.

When the operator is deployed, part of the deployment process
is to copy the required strategy templates into a ConfigMap (*operator-conf*)
that gets mounted into */operator-conf* within the operator pod.

The directory structure of the strategy templates is as
follows:
....
|-- backup-job.json
|-- cluster
|   |-- 1
|       |-- cluster-deployment-1.json
|       |-- cluster-replica-deployment-1.json
|       |-- cluster-service-1.json
|
|-- pvc.json
....

In this structure, each strategy's templates live in a subdirectory
that matches the strategy identifier.  The default strategy templates
are denoted by the value of *1* in the directory structure above.

If you add another strategy, the file names *must* be unique within
the entire strategy directory.  This is due to the way the templates
are stored within the ConfigMap.


=== Default Cluster Deployment Strategy (1)

Using the default cluster strategy, a *cluster* when created by the operator will create the
following on a Kube cluster:

 * deployment running a Postgres *primary* container with replica count of 1
 * service mapped to the *primary* Postgres database
 * service mapped to the *replica* Postgres database
 * PVC for the *primary* will be created if not specified in configuration, this
   assumes you are using a non-shared volume technology (e.g. Amazon EBS),
   if the CLUSTER.PVC_NAME value is set in your configuration then a
   shared volume technology is assumed (e.g. HostPath or NFS), if a PVC
   is created for the primary, the naming convention is *clustername*
   where clustername is the name of your cluster.

If you want to add a Postgres replica to a cluster, you will
*scale* the cluster, for each *replica-count*, a Deployment
will be created that acts as a Postgres replica.

This is very different than using say a StatefulSet to scale
up Postgres.  Why would I do it this way?  Imagine a case
where you want different parts of your Postgres cluster to
use different storage configurations, I can do that by doing
specific placement and deployments of each part of the cluster.

This same concept applies to node selection for your Postgres
cluster components.  The Operator will let you define precisely
which node you want each Postgres component to be placed upon
using node affinity rules.

=== Cluster Deletion

When you run the following:
....
pgo delete cluster mycluster
....

The cluster and its services will be deleted.  However the data files
and backup files will remain, same with the PVCs for this cluster, they
all remain.

However, to remove the data files from the PVC you can pass a flag:
....
--delete-data
....
which will cause a workflow to be started to actually remove the
data files on the primary cluster deployment PVC.

Also, if you pass a flag:
....
--delete-backups
....
it will cause *all* the backup files to be removed.

The data removal workflow includes the following steps:

 * create a pgtask CRD to hold the PVC name and cluster name to be removed
 * the CRD is watched, and on an ADD will cause a Job to be created that will run the *rmdata* container using the PVC name and cluster name as parameters which determine the PVC to mount, and the file path to remove under that PVC
 * the *rmdata* Job is watched by the Operator, and upon a successful status completion the actual PVC is removed

This workflow insures that a PVC is not removed until all the data files are removed.  Also, a Job was used for the removal of files since that can be a time consuming task.

The files are removed by the *rmdata* container which essentially
issues the following command to remove the files:
....
rm -rf /pgdata/<some path>
....

=== Custom Postgres Configurations

Starting in release 2.5, users and administrators can specify a
custom set of Postgres configuration files be used when creating
a new Postgres cluster.  The configuration files you can
change include:

 * postgresql.conf
 * pg_hba.conf
 * setup.sql

Different configurations for Postgres might be defined for
the following:

 * OLTP types of databases
 * OLAP types of databases
 * High Memory
 * Minimal Configuration for Development
 * Project Specific configurations
 * Special Security Requirements

==== Global ConfigMap

If you create a *configMap* called *pgo-custom-pg-config* with any
of the above files within it, new clusters will use those configuration
files when setting up a new database instance.  You do *NOT* have to
specify all of the configuration files, its up to your use case
which ones to use.

An example set of configuration files and a script to create the
global configMap is found at:
....
$COROOT/examples/custom-config
....

If you run the *create.sh* script there, it will create the configMap
that will include the Postgres configuration files within that directory.

==== Config Files Purpose

The *postgresql.conf* file is the main Postgresql configuration file allowing you to define a wide variety of tuning parameters and features.

The *pg_hba.conf* file is the way Postgresql secures down client access.

The *setup.sql* file is a Crunchy Container Suite configuration
file used to initially populate the database after the initial *initdb*
is run when the database is first created.  You would make changes
to this if you wanted to define what database objects always
are created.

==== Granular Config Maps

So, lets say you want to use a different set of configuration
files for different clusters instead of having just a single
configuration (e.g. Global Config Map).  You can create
your own set of ConfigMaps with their own set of Postgresql
configuration files.  When creating new clusters, you 
can pass a *--custom-config* flag along with the name of your
ConfigMap and that will be used for that specific cluster or
set of clusters.

==== Default

Lets say you are happy with the default Postgresql configuration
files that ship with the Crunchy Postgres container.  You don't have
to do anything essentially, just keep using the Operator as normal.
Just be sure to not define a global configMap or pass the
command line flag.

==== Labeling

You will notice that when a custom configMap is used in cluster
creation, the Operator labels the primary Postgres Deployment
with a label that hase a *custom-config* label and a value
of what configMap was used when creating the database.

Commands coming in future releases will take advantage of this
labeling.

=== Metrics Collection

If you add a *--metrics* flag to *pgo create cluster* it will 
cause the *crunchy-collect* container to be added to your
Postgres cluster.

That container requires you run the *crunchy-metrics* containers
as defined within the *crunchy-containers* project.  

The *prometheus push gateway* that is deployed as part of the
*crunchy-metrics* example is a current requirement for the
metrics solution.  This will change in an upcoming
release of the *crunchy-containers* project and there will
no longer be a requirement for the push gateway to be deployed.

See https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/blob/master/docs/metrics.adoc and https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/blob/master/docs/examples.adoc#metrics-collection for more details on setting up the *crunchy-metrics* solution.
