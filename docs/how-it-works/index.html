v3.0, {docdate}

== Reference Architecture

So, what does the Postgres Operator actually deploy
when you create a cluster?

image::/OperatorReferenceDiagram.png[Operator Reference Diagram]

On this diagram, objects with dashed lines are components
that are optionally deployed as part of a PostgreSQL Cluster
by the operator. Objects with solid lines are the fundamental and
required components.

For example, within the Primary Deployment, the *metrics* container
is completely optional. That component can be deployed using
either the operator configuration or command line arguments if you
want to cause metrics to be collected from the Postgres container.

Replica deployments are similar to the primary deployment but
are optional. A replica is not required to be created unless the
capability for one is necessary. As you scale up the Postgres
cluster, the standard set of components gets deployed and
replication to the primary is started.

Notice that each cluster deployment gets its own unique
Persistent Volumes. Each volume can use different storage
configurations which is quite powerful.

== Custom Resource Definitions

Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions are used in the design
of the PostgreSQL Operator to define the following -

 * Cluster - *pgclusters*
 * Backup - *pgbackups*
 * Upgrade - *pgupgrades*
 * Policy - *pgpolicies*
 * Tasks - *pgtasks*

== Command Line Interface

The pgo command line interface (CLI) is used by a normal end-user
to create databases or clusters, or make changes to existing databases.

The CLI interacts with the *apiserver* REST API deployed
within the *postgres-operator* deployment.

From the CLI, users can view existing clusters that
were deployed using the CLI and Operator. Objects that were
not previously created by the Crunchy Operator are now viewable from
the CLI.

== Operator Deployment

The PostgreSQL Operator runs within a Deployment in the Kubernetes
cluster.  An administrator will deploy the operator deployment
using the provided script. Once installed and running, the Operator
pod will start watching for certain defined events.

The operator watches for create/update/delete actions on
the *pgcluster* custom resource definitions.  When
the CLI creates for example a new *pgcluster* custom resource
definition, the operator catches that event and creates pods and services
for that new cluster request.

== CLI Design

The CLI uses the cobra package to implement CLI functionality
like help text, config file processing, and command line parsing.

The *pgo* client is essentially a REST client which communicates
to the *pgo-apiserver* REST server running within the Operator pod.  In
some cases you might want to split the apiserver out into its own
Deployment but the default deployment has a consolidated pod
that contains both the apiserver and operator containers simply for
convenience of deployment and updates.

=== Verbs

A user works with the CLI by entering verbs to indicate
what they want to do, as follows.
[source,bash]
----
pgo show cluster all
pgo delete cluster db1 db2 db3
pgo create cluster mycluster
----

In the above example, the *show*, *backup*, *delete*, and *create* verbs are used. The CLI is case sensitive and supports only lowercase.

== Affinity

You can have the Operator add an affinity section to
a new Cluster Deployment if you want to cause Kubernetes to
attempt to schedule a primary cluster to a specific Kubernetes node.

You can see the nodes on your Kube cluster by running the following -
....
kubectl get nodes
....

You can then specify one of those names (e.g. kubeadm-node2)  when creating a cluster -
....
pgo create cluster thatcluster --node-name=kubeadm-node2
....

The affinity rule inserted in the Deployment will used a *preferred*
strategy so that if the node were down or not available, Kube would
go ahead and schedule the Pod on another node.

You can always view the actual node your cluster pod is scheduled
on through the following command.
....
kubectl get pod -o wide
....

When you scale up a Cluster and add a replica, the scaling will
take into account the use of `--node-name`.  If it sees that a
cluster was created with a specific node name, then the replica
Deployment will add an affinity rule to attempt to schedule
the replica on a different node than the node the primary is
schedule on. This provides a simple version of high availability and
causes the primary and replicas to not live on the same Kubernetes
node.


== Debugging

To see if the operator pod is running enter the following -

[source,bash]
....
kubectl get pod -l 'name=postgres-operator'
....

To verify the operator is running and has deployed the Custom Resources execute the following -

....
kubectl get crd
....

The full list of CRDs that are created over time are shown below.
....
NAME                               KIND
pgbackups.cr.client-go.k8s.io      CustomResourceDefinition.v1beta1.apiextensions.k8s.io
pgclusters.cr.client-go.k8s.io     CustomResourceDefinition.v1beta1.apiextensions.k8s.io
pgpolicies.cr.client-go.k8s.io     CustomResourceDefinition.v1beta1.apiextensions.k8s.io
pgpolicylogs.cr.client-go.k8s.io   CustomResourceDefinition.v1beta1.apiextensions.k8s.io
pgupgrades.cr.client-go.k8s.io     CustomResourceDefinition.v1beta1.apiextensions.k8s.io
pgtasks.cr.client-go.k8s.io        CustomResourceDefinition.v1beta1.apiextensions.k8s.io
....

== Persistent Volumes

Currently, the operator does not delete persistent volumes by default. Instead,
it deletes the claims on the volumes. Starting with release 2.4, the Operator
will create Jobs that actually run *rm* commands on the data volumes before
actually removing the Persistent Volumes if the user passes a `--delete-data `
flag when deleting a database cluster.

Likewise, if the user passes `--delete-backups` during cluster deletion
a Job is created to remove all the backups for a cluster include
the related Persistent Volume.

== PostgreSQL Operator Deployment Strategies

This section describes the various deployment strategies
offered by the operator.  A deployment in this case is
the set of objects created in Kubernetes when a
custom resource definition of type *pgcluster* is created.
CRDs are created by the pgo client command and acted upon
by the postgres operator.

=== Strategies

To support different types of deployments, the operator supports
multiple strategy implementations.  Currently there is
only a default *cluster* strategy.

In the future, more deployment strategies will be supported
to offer users more customization to what they see deployed
in their Kubernetes cluster.

Being open source, users can also write their own strategy!

=== Specifying a Strategy

In the pgo client configuration file, there is a
`CLUSTER.STRATEGY `setting.  The current value of the
default strategy is *1*.  If you don't set that value, the
default strategy is assumed.  If you set that value to something
not supported, the operator will log an error.

=== Strategy Template Files

Each strategy supplies its set of templates used by the operator
to create new pods, services, etc.

When the operator is deployed, part of the deployment process
is to copy the required strategy templates into a ConfigMap (*operator-conf*)
that gets mounted into `/operator-conf` within the operator pod.

The directory structure of the strategy templates is as
follows -
....
|-- backup-job.json
|-- cluster
|   |-- 1
|       |-- cluster-deployment-1.json
|       |-- cluster-replica-deployment-1.json
|       |-- cluster-service-1.json
|
|-- pvc.json
....

In this structure, each strategy's templates live in a subdirectory
that matches the strategy identifier.  The default strategy templates
are denoted by the value of *1* in the directory structure above.

If you add another strategy, the file names *must* be unique within
the entire strategy directory.  This is due to the way the templates
are stored within the ConfigMap.

=== Default Cluster Deployment Strategy (1)

Using the default cluster strategy, a *cluster* when created by the operator will create the
following on a Kubernetes cluster -

 * deployment running a Postgres *primary* container with replica count of 1
 * service mapped to the *primary* Postgres database
 * service mapped to the *replica* Postgres database
 * PVC for the *primary* will be created if not specified in configuration, this
   assumes you are using a non-shared volume technology (e.g. Amazon EBS),
   if the `CLUSTER.PVC_NAME` value is set in your configuration then a
   shared volume technology is assumed (e.g. HostPath or NFS), if a PVC
   is created for the primary, the naming convention is *clustername*
   where clustername is the name of your cluster.

If you want to add a Postgres replica to a cluster, you will
*scale* the cluster. For each *replica-count*, a Deployment
will be created that acts as a PostgreSQL replica.

This is very different than using a StatefulSet to scale
up PostgreSQL.  Why would you do it this way? Imagine a case
where you want different parts of your PostgreSQL cluster to
use different storage configurations,. With this method, it can
be done through using specific placement and deployments of each
part of the cluster.

This same concept applies to node selection for the PostgreSQL
cluster components.  The Operator will let you define precisely
which node that the PostgreSQL component should be placed upon
using node affinity rules.

=== Cluster Deletion

When you run the following, the cluster and its services will be
deleted.  However, the data files and backup files will remain as
well as the PVCs for this cluster.
....
pgo delete cluster mycluster
....

However, to remove the data files from the PVC you can pass the following flag -
....
--delete-data
....

This causes a workflow to be started to remove the
data files on the primary cluster deployment PVC.

The following flag will cause *all* of the backup files
to be removed.
....
--delete-backups
....

The data removal workflow includes the following steps -

 * create a pgtask CRD to hold the PVC name and cluster name to be removed
 * the CRD is watched, and on an ADD will cause a Job to be created that will run the *rmdata* container using the PVC name and cluster name as parameters which determine the PVC to mount, and the file path to remove under that PVC
 * the *rmdata* Job is watched by the Operator, and upon a successful status completion the actual PVC is removed

This workflow insures that a PVC is not removed until all the data files are removed.  Also, a Job was used for the removal of files since that can be a time consuming task.

The files are removed by the *rmdata* container which essentially
issues the following command to remove the files -
....
rm -rf /pgdata/<some path>
....

=== Custom Postgres Configurations

Starting in release 2.5, users and administrators can specify a
custom set of Postgres configuration files be used when creating
a new Postgres cluster.  The configuration files you can
change include -

 * postgresql.conf
 * pg_hba.conf
 * setup.sql

Different configurations for PostgreSQL might be defined for
the following -

 * OLTP types of databases
 * OLAP types of databases
 * High Memory
 * Minimal Configuration for Development
 * Project Specific configurations
 * Special Security Requirements

==== Global ConfigMap

If you create a *configMap* called *pgo-custom-pg-config* with any
of the above files within it, new clusters will use those configuration
files when setting up a new database instance.  You do *NOT* have to
specify all of the configuration files. It is entirely up to your use case
to determine which to use.

An example set of configuration files and a script to create the
global configMap is found at -
....
$COROOT/examples/custom-config
....

If you run the *create.sh* script there, it will create the configMap
that will include the PostgreSQL configuration files within that directory.

==== Config Files Purpose

The *postgresql.conf* file is the main Postgresql configuration file that allows
the definition of a wide variety of tuning parameters and features.

The *pg_hba.conf* file is the way Postgresql secures client access.

The *setup.sql* file is a Crunchy Container Suite configuration
file used to initially populate the database after the initial *initdb*
is run when the database is first created. Changes would be made
to this if you wanted to define which database objects are created by
default.

==== Granular Config Maps

Granular config maps can be defined if it is necessary to use
a different set of configuration files for different clusters
rather than having a single configuration (e.g. Global Config Map).
A specific set of ConfigMaps with their own set of PostgreSQL
configuration files can be created. When creating new clusters, a
`--custom-config` flag can be passed along with the name of the
ConfigMap which will be used for that specific cluster or set of
clusters.

==== Defaults

If there's no reason to change the default PostgreSQL configuration
files that ship with the Crunchy Postgres container, there's no
requirement to. In this event, continue using the Operator as usual
and avoid defining a global configMap.

==== Labeling

When a custom configMap is used in cluster creation, the Operator
labels the primary Postgres Deployment with a label of
*custom-config* and a value of what configMap was used when creating
the database.

Commands coming in future releases will take advantage of this
labeling.

=== Metrics Collection

If you add a *--metrics* flag to *pgo create cluster* it will
cause the *crunchy-collect* container to be added to your
Postgres cluster.

That container requires you run the *crunchy-metrics* containers
as defined within the *crunchy-containers* project.

The *prometheus push gateway* that is deployed as part of the
*crunchy-metrics* example is a current requirement for the
metrics solution.  This will change in an upcoming
release of the *crunchy-containers* project and there will
no longer be a requirement for the push gateway to be deployed.

See link:https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/blob/master/docs/examples.adoc#metrics-collection[the crunchy-containers Metrics example] for more details on setting up the *crunchy-metrics* solution.
