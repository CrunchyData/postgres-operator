# created for the Operator Service Account, with those cluster roles (or the absence thereof)

#
# A value of "dynamic" enables full dynamic namespace capabilities, in which the Operator can
# create, delete and update any namespaces within the Kubernetes cluster.  Additionally, while in 
# this mode the Operator can listen for namespace events (e.g. namespace additions, updates and 
# deletions), and then create or remove controllers for various namespaces as those namespaces are
# added or removed from the Kubernetes cluster and/or Operator install.
# 
# If a value of "readonly" is provided, the Operator is still able to listen for namespace events
# within the  Kubernetetes cluster, and then create and run and/or remove controllers as namespaces
# are added and deleted.  However, the Operator is unable to create, delete and/or update 
# namespaces.
#
# And finally, if "disabled" is selected, then namespace capabilities will be disabled altogether
# In this mode the Operator will simply attempt to work with the target namespaces specified during 
# installation.  If no target namespaces are specified, then it will be configured to work within the
# namespace in which it is deployed.
