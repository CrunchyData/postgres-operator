# This is a workaround for changes introduced in pgBackRest v2.24.  Specifically, a pg1-path
# setting must now be visible when another container executes a pgBackRest command via SSH.
# Since env vars, and therefore the PGBACKREST_DB_PATH setting, is not visible when another
# container executes a command via SSH, this adds the pg1-path setting to the pgBackRest config
# file instead, ensuring the setting is always available in the environment during SSH calls.
# Additionally, since the value for pg1-path setting in the repository container is irrelevant
# (i.e. the value specified by the container running the command via SSH is used instead), it is
# simply set to a dummy directory within the config file.
# If the URI style is set to 'path' instead of the default 'host' value, pgBackRest will
# connect to S3 by prependinging bucket names to URIs instead of the default 'bucket.endpoint' style
# Finally, if TLS verification is set to 'n', pgBackRest disables verification of the S3 server
# certificate.
