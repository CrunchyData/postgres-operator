# NOTE: this is script is intended for setting up development environments to
# use NFS as the persistent volume storage area. It is **not** intended for
# production.
#
# This script makes some assumptions, i.e:
#
# - You have sudo
# - You have your NFS filesystem mounted to the location you are running this
#   script
# - Your NFS filesystem is mounted to /nfsfileshare
# - Your PV names will be one of "crunchy-pvNNN" where NNN is a natural number
# - Your NFS UID:GID is "nfsnobody:nfsnobody", which correspunds to "65534:65534"
#
# And awaaaay we go...
